 *Title:* *“God’s Presence in the Darkness”*

*Key Scripture:* Exodus 20:21 – “The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.”

---

*Introduction:*

We often associate God with light, clarity, and joy. However, Scripture reveals that God also dwells in darkness. In Exodus 20:21, Moses approaches the thick darkness where God was. This challenges our understanding and invites us to explore God's presence in the midst of uncertainty and trials.

---

*Main Points:*

1. *God Meets Us in the Darkness:*
   - Throughout the Bible, God reveals Himself in dark moments:
     - To Abraham in a dark vision (Genesis 15).
     - To Jacob during a night of wrestling (Genesis 32).
     - To the Israelites in a cloud of darkness on Mount Sinai (Exodus 20:21).
   - These instances show that darkness is not the absence of God but a setting for divine encounters.

2. *Darkness as a Place of Transformation:*
   - In the darkness, our distractions fade, and we become more attuned to God's voice.
   - Challenges and uncertainties can lead to spiritual growth and deeper faith.
   - Embracing these moments allows God to work profoundly in our lives.

3. *Faith Beyond Sight:*
- Walking through darkness requires trust in God's character and promises.
   - 2 Corinthians 5:7 reminds us, “For we walk by faith, not by sight.”
   - Even when we can't see the path ahead, we can trust that God is guiding us.


*Conclusion:*

God's presence isn't limited to moments of clarity and joy. He is equally present in our darkest hours, offering guidance, comfort, and transformation. Let us not fear the darkness but embrace it as an opportunity to draw closer to Him. 🙏*🎥 Watch the Video

Chronic Hand Dermatitis (CHD) is one of the most persistent and misdiagnosed skin conditions worldwide. It often appears as redness, scaling, itching, and painful cracks on the hands. For many, this condition lingers for months or even years, despite various treatments. The journey of sufferers is often marked by confusion, frustration, and repeated misdiagnosis鈥攅specially when the underlying cause is not what it seems.

馃攳 Why is it a Mystery?
The term 鈥渕ystery鈥 stems from the condition鈥檚 deceptive nature. CHD shares visual and symptomatic similarities with many other skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, or allergic reactions. As a result, patients are frequently prescribed steroid creams or moisturizers that may temporarily soothe the symptoms, but do not treat the root cause鈥攅specially if the actual issue is a fungal infection.

鈿狅笍 The Hidden Culprit 
Studies have shown that in up to *38% of cases*, what appears to be dermatitis is actually a *fungal infection*. Unfortunately, the misuse of corticosteroids (intended for eczema) can worsen fungal infections, making them harder to diagnose and treat later. This creates a cycle of mismanagement that prolongs the suffering of patients.

Clinical Perspective
Dermatologists emphasize that *accurate diagnosis is key*. Without proper fungal cultures, KOH tests, or skin biopsies, it's nearly impossible to distinguish CHD from other mimicking conditions. Unfortunately, these tests are often overlooked in favor of symptomatic treatment.

Re al-life ImpactMany
 people live with hand dermatitis that doesn鈥檛 respond to treatment, leading to:
- Lost confidence and self-esteem
- Trouble working, especially in jobs that require hand hygiene
- Dependency on topical steroids, which can cause long-term skin damage

馃檹 A Call for Awareness
Understanding the *true nature* of CHD is the first step toward healing. Whether it is caused by allergens, irritants, or hidden fungal infections, the path to effective treatment begins with proper diagnosis and patient education.

Chronic Hand Dermatitis (CHD) is a persistent skin condition that affects millions of people globally, yet it remains widely misunderstood. It is not a single disease but a *complex combination of genetic, environmental, and occupational factors* that contribute to recurring inflammation of the hands.
---
馃┖ *What is Chronic Hand Dermatitis?*
CHD is an inflammation of the skin on the hands that persists for *three months or more*, or recurs *two or more times a year*. It can range from mild dryness and redness to severe cracking, blistering, and pain that interferes with daily activities.
1. *Irritant Contact Dermatitis* 鈥 Caused by repeated exposure to soaps, sanitizers, or chemicals.
2. *Allergic Contact Dermatitis* 鈥 Triggered by allergens like nickel, latex, or fragrances.
3. *Atopic Hand Dermatitis* 鈥 Associated with personal or family history of atopic conditions (eczema, asthma).
4. *Hyperkeratotic Hand Dermatitis* 鈥 Characterized by thick, scaly skin, often mistaken for psoriasis.
---
- *Frequent Handwashing*: Essential for hygiene but strips the skin of its natural oils. 
- *Occupational Exposure*: Hairdressers, health workers, cleaners, mechanics, and farmers are at higher risk. 
- *Occupational Exposure*: Hairdressers, health workers, cleaners, mechanics, and farmers are at higher risk.
- *Incorrect Treatment*: Treating fungal infections as eczema can worsen the condition.
- *Chronic Inflammation Cycle*: Repeated scratching and irritation fuel ongoing inflammation.

- Emotional distress and embarrassment
- Physical pain and discomfort
- Missed workdays and reduced productivity
- Overuse of steroid creams leading to thinning of the skin
---
*Navigating the Way Forward*
Proper understanding is the first step to breaking the cycle of misdiagnosis. Identifying the exact cause, avoiding triggers, and *personalized treatment plans* are key to managing CHD effectively.

Getting Out of Babylon: Understanding Suffering and the Power of God
Introduction:
We live in a world full of distractions, confusion, and pain. The temptation to stay connected to the world’s systems—often symbolized as "Babylon"—pulls us away from the true peace God offers. But getting out of Babylon means more than just leaving a physical place; it involves breaking free from the world's destructive influences, lies, and suffering. 
Let’s look at why we suffer, where suffering comes from, and who is in charge of all suffering, to help us understand our journey out of Babylon and how to find true healing and peace in Christ.
1. Why Do We Suffer?
- Human Condition and Free Will:
  - The root of suffering comes from humanity’s fall in the Garden of Eden. When Adam and Eve disobeyed God, sin entered the world, and along with it, suffering, pain, and death.
  - Romans 5:12 – “Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned.”
- Galatians 6:7 reminds us that the choices we make have consequences: “Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.” Sometimes, we suffer because of poor choices, either our own or others’ actions.
- Suffering as a Result of Babylon's Influence:
  - Babylon symbolizes the world’s temptations, pride, and distractions. The world calls us to chase after wealth, fame, and selfish desires, which often lead to pain and emptiness.
  - 1 John 2:16 – “For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world.”
- Spiritual Growth Through Suffering:
  - God uses suffering to refine us and strengthen our character. It’s a part of the process of growing in faith and trust in Him.
  - Romans 5:3-4 – “Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.”
  - James 1:2-4 encourages us to find joy in suffering: “Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking
