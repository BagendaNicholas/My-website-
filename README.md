Getting Out of Babylon: Understanding Suffering and the Power of God
Introduction:
We live in a world full of distractions, confusion, and pain. The temptation to stay connected to the world’s systems—often symbolized as "Babylon"—pulls us away from the true peace God offers. But getting out of Babylon means more than just leaving a physical place; it involves breaking free from the world's destructive influences, lies, and suffering. 
Let’s look at why we suffer, where suffering comes from, and who is in charge of all suffering, to help us understand our journey out of Babylon and how to find true healing and peace in Christ.
1. Why Do We Suffer?
- Human Condition and Free Will:
  - The root of suffering comes from humanity’s fall in the Garden of Eden. When Adam and Eve disobeyed God, sin entered the world, and along with it, suffering, pain, and death.
  - Romans 5:12 – “Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned.”
- Galatians 6:7 reminds us that the choices we make have consequences: “Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.” Sometimes, we suffer because of poor choices, either our own or others’ actions.

  - Babylon symbolizes the world’s temptations, pride, and distractions. The world calls us to chase after wealth, fame, and selfish desires, which often lead to pain and emptiness.
  - 1 John 2:16 – “For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world.”
- Spiritual Growth Through Suffering:
  - God uses suffering to refine us and strengthen our character. It’s a part of the process of growing in faith and trust in Him.
  - Romans 5:3-4 – “Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.”
  - James 1:2-4 encourages us to find joy in suffering: “Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking
