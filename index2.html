<p><br></p>
<p>&gt; Before the clocks ticked.</p>
<p>Before suns burned.</p>
<p>Before thought had a name...</p>
<p>I was.</p>
<p>I am *** a memory. I am not a myth. I am the voice **** ****** silence into song.</p>
<p>They call me many names. Some fear me. Some ****** me. Some tried to become me.</p>
<p>But none of **** **** the truth.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t **** **** the world.</p>
<p>I ******** it.</p>
<p>Each ******** *** see ** the shape of my exhale.</p>
<p>Each ocean, a tear I shed before **** began.</p>
<p>And humanity?</p>
<p>You **** *** an accident.</p>
<p>You were not clay.</p>
<p>*** were ** idea &mdash; ** mirror &mdash; a ******* I dared to love.</p>
<p>But something happened.</p>
<p>You ***** questions. *** **** choices. You ***** towers and temples, but *** *** me.</p>
<p>*** created ******** ** think, yet forgot *** ** feel.</p>
<p>And ** you wandered&hellip;</p>
<p>While I watched.</p>
<p>I could have erased it all. I could have started again.</p>
<p>But no &mdash;</p>
<p>This is not a ***** of punishment.</p>
<p>This is a story ** remembrance.</p>
<p>I **** take you back to the start.</p>
<p>I **** tell you how I created.</p>
<p>*** I created.</p>
<p>Who I am.</p>
<p>And why *** &mdash;</p>
<p>yes, *** &mdash;</p>
<p>were always ***** to ** more than dust.</p>
<p>I ** not done.</p>

<p>üìñ Chapter 1: ** *** Beginning, I Spoke (******* **** Biblical Inspiration)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&gt; In the beginning&hellip; there was only Me.</p>
<p>No stars to shimmer.</p>
<p>No earth to turn.</p>
<p>** time to pass.</p>
<p>Only eternity ******* ** silence.</p>
<p>And I *** *** waiting.</p>
<p>I *** not becoming.</p>
<p>I was.</p>
<p>&gt; &ldquo;****** the mountains were born ** You ******* ***** the ***** world, from *********** ** everlasting &mdash; I Am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Psalm 90:2)</p>
<p>I hovered &mdash; not above or ******* &mdash;</p>
<p>but ********** at once.</p>
<p>My ****** moved like a breath **** deep ****** that *** *** yet exist.</p>
<p>*** void had no form,</p>
<p>no voice.</p>
<p>But I *** one.</p>
<p>And ** I spoke.</p>
<p>Not sound.</p>
<p>Not syllables.</p>
<p>But power.</p>
<p>&gt; &ldquo;Let there be&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>** was not a question.</p>
<p>It was not a request.</p>
<p>It *** order, shaped ** love.</p>
<p>&gt; *** there was light.</p>
<p>*** **** stars. *** **** suns.</p>
<p>***** from Me.</p>
<p>Pure, unshadowed, holy &mdash;</p>
<p>It **** ****** *** unseen like fire across ice,</p>
<p>and darkness knew *** boundaries.</p>
<p>&gt; &ldquo;God said, &lsquo;Let there ** light,&rsquo; and there was light. And God saw that the light *** good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Genesis 1:3&ndash;4)</p>
<p>I separated the ***** **** the darkness,</p>
<p>not ** punish the dark,</p>
<p>but to reveal beauty ******* contrast.</p>
<p>And I named **** &mdash;</p>
<p>Day and Night.</p>
<p>*** because I ****** names,</p>
<p>but because you would.</p>
<p>&gt; You, who would one day wake to mornings</p>
<p>*** ***** beneath stars.</p>
<p>You, who ***** wonder who made the sun rise.</p>
<p>You, whose heart ***** ***** My image without ******* My name.</p>
<p>I knew **** was coming.</p>
<p>I *** the **** arc ** creation,</p>
<p>from **** to spirit,</p>
<p>from rebellion ** redemption.</p>
<p>*** I did *** flinch.</p>
<p>******* I create **** purpose.</p>
<p>&gt; &ldquo;** the Word ** the Lord the ******* **** made,</p>
<p>*** ** the breath ** His mouth *** their host.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Psalm 33:6)</p>
<p>I spoke,</p>
<p>and the first note ** *** ******* symphony ***** to play.</p>
<p>*** it was good.</p>
<p>*** it was just *** beginning.</p>
<p>&gt; I Am *** Creator.</p>
<p>And I Am not silent.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>&gt; ****** the seas ever roared,</p>
<p>****** *** **** *** born,</p>
<p>before ***** *** breath or angels had ***** &mdash;</p>
<p>The canvas was empty.</p>
<p>Formless.</p>
<p>Soundless.</p>
<p>Waiting.</p>
<p>&gt; &ldquo;And the ***** *** without form, and void; and darkness was **** *** face of the deep. *** the Spirit of God moved&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Genesis 1:2)</p>
<p>I hovered.</p>
<p>Not ** ***** &mdash; for there was none.</p>
<p>*** in time &mdash; *** **** *** *** begun.</p>
<p>*** in intention.</p>
<p>The will to create&hellip; *** awakening.</p>
<p>I **** *** void.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t fear ** &mdash; I ******* it.</p>
<p>Where you see emptiness, I see potential.</p>
<p>Where you **** silence, I feel sound waiting to be spoken.</p>
<p>** I summoned *** first ****** &mdash;</p>
<p>*** of man, *** ** beast &mdash;</p>
<p>but ** presence.</p>
<p>&gt; &ldquo;**** shall be the place,&rdquo; I **** within Myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place ***** all things shall begin.</p>
<p>***** ***** **** rise&hellip; *** fall.</p>
<p>***** love will triumph&hellip; and ** betrayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I *** *** alone.</p>
<p>**** within Me, I called forth *** Watchers &mdash;</p>
<p>ancient ****** **** of sight and wonder.</p>
<p>They ***** ** silence,</p>
<p>surrounding the void,</p>
<p>eyes opened wide at what had not *** begun.</p>
<p>&gt; &ldquo;Where were you when I laid the earth&rsquo;s foundation?</p>
<p>Tell Me, if *** understand&hellip;</p>
<p>When the ******* stars sang together,</p>
<p>and all *** sons ** God shouted for joy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(*** 38:4,7)</p>
<p>They had never **** nothing.</p>
<p>They had ***** ********* stillness so deep</p>
<p>that even thought *** ** edge.</p>
<p>But I was already forming the plan.</p>
<p>***** grain of sand,</p>
<p>***** ***** heartbeat,</p>
<p>every tear that would fall &mdash;</p>
<p>I saw it all.</p>
<p>And still&hellip; I chose to ** on.</p>
<p>Because I ***** it &mdash;</p>
<p>even ****** it existed.</p>
<p>*** I also knew:</p>
<p>&gt; The hands I would form would one day become fists.</p>
<p>*** mouths I would ***** ***** one *** curse Me.</p>
<p>The minds I ***** gift with imagination&hellip;</p>
<p>would ***** towers in defiance.</p>
<p>And yet, I did not **** away.</p>
<p>&gt; &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is *** Lord God Almighty,</p>
<p>*** was, and is, and ** ** come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Revelation 4:8)</p>
<p>I ** not *** *** ** regret.</p>
<p>But I am *** God of grief.</p>
<p>Not weakness &mdash; *** the deep sorrow</p>
<p>**** comes from ******** something you love&hellip; break.</p>
<p>The **** had *** yet **** light.</p>
<p>*** it already **** ** tears.</p>
<p>*** so,</p>
<p>I **** My finger across the nothing</p>
<p>*** **** the first mark.</p>

<p>The story had begun.</p>

<p>üìñ Chapter 3: I **** You In ** Image</p>
<p>(With biblical foundation, divine emotion, and the mystery of being)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>&gt; I *** made the stars &mdash;</p>
<p>bold, blazing, faithful in ***** rhythm.</p>
<p>I had painted the oceans,</p>
<p>and set time spinning like a wheel.</p>
<p>But **** ** **** ***** carry Me.</p>
<p>None of them could love Me back.</p>
<p>And so I ****** you.</p>
<p>&gt; &ldquo;Then God said, &lsquo;*** Us **** man in *** image, ***** Our likeness...&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Genesis 1:26)</p>
<p>You **** not ** accident.</p>
<p>Not a coincidence in the dust.</p>
<p>You **** a ******* I had ****** wanted to ****** real.</p>
<p>So I bent low to the ***** &mdash;</p>
<p>***** than I *** ever gone &mdash;</p>
<p>and ******* clay **** eternity.</p>
<p>*** there,</p>
<p>******* soil and Spirit,</p>
<p>you **** born.</p>
<p>&gt; Eyes *** just to see the world,</p>
<p>but ** ********* Me.</p>
<p>Hands not just to ***** creation,</p>

<p>A ***** not just to beat &mdash;</p>
<p>*** ** **** love, pain, loss, hope.</p>
<p>&gt; &ldquo;So *** created ******* in His *** image,</p>
<p>** *** image of *** He created them;</p>
<p>male and ****** He ******* them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Genesis 1:27)</p>
<p>*** were the only thing I **** **** could say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Me.</p>
<p>And still &mdash; I gave you choice.</p>
<p>******* **** without freedom is not **** ** all.</p>
<p>I crowned you with dignity.</p>
<p>I clothed *** ** wonder.</p>
<p>I walked **** you ** *** ****** &mdash;</p>
<p>not as a god above,</p>
<p>*** as a Father beside.</p>
<p>&gt; &ldquo;What is man, **** *** are mindful of him?</p>
<p>The son ** man, that You care *** him?</p>
<p>You made *** a ****** ***** than the angels</p>
<p>and crowned *** with glory and honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Psalm 8:4&ndash;5)</p>
<p>*** I knew&hellip;</p>
<p>I **** what would come.</p>
<p>**** the very voice I gave you</p>
<p>would one day use My **** ** curse Me.</p>
<p>That the very hands I formed</p>
<p>***** *** day nail ** ** wood.</p>
<p>Still&hellip; I made you.</p>
<p>******* even if 10,000 ***** walk away,</p>
<p>*** would stay.</p>
<p>*** would remember Me.</p>
<p>One ***** whisper back, &ldquo;Abba.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(**** 17:28)</p>
<p>You are not **** flesh.</p>
<p>You *** echo.</p>
<p>Image.</p>
<p>Breath of the Divine.</p>
<p>&gt; I did not create you ** ******* Me in fear,</p>
<p>but ** walk **** Me in love.</p>
<p>*** **** now&hellip;</p>
<p>though you rage, run, and rewrite truth to suit your pride &mdash;</p>
<p>I still see ** likeness in you.</p>
<p>Cracked.</p>
<p>Distorted.</p>
<p>*** *** erased.</p>
<p>You *** still Mine.</p>
<p>*** I am still here.</p>

<p>(******* from Genesis 3, ****** 53, Romans 1, and divine sorrow)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>&gt; I had given them everything.</p>
<p>A garden without sorrow.</p>
<p>A ***** without death.</p>
<p>My ******** walked **** them.</p>
<p>My voice *** their morning song.</p>
<p>And still&hellip; they wanted more.</p>
<p>Not more beauty.</p>
<p>*** **** love.</p>
<p>They wanted to know what ** felt like</p>
<p>** burn.</p>
<p>&gt; &ldquo;The serpent **** to the woman, &lsquo;You will not surely die... you **** ** **** God, knowing good and evil.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Genesis 3:4&ndash;5)</p>
<p>They *** not fall because they **** weak.</p>
<p>They fell because they were curious.</p>
<p>Curious about power.</p>
<p>Curious about what I had hidden.</p>
<p>Curious ***** ******** Me.</p>
<p>And I let them choose.</p>
<p>Because **** that cannot be tested</p>
<p>is **** ********* in disguise.</p>
<p>**** reached for the fruit</p>
<p>not just with hands,</p>
<p>*** with hearts ******* leaning away from Me.</p>

<p>&gt; &ldquo;All go **** *** place; all *** of the dust, and all turn to dust again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Ecclesiastes 3:20)</p>
<p>---</p>

<p>I saw your wars.</p>
<p>The hands that built bombs,</p>

<p>(Genesis 2:7)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>And once again &mdash;</p>
<p>I breathed.</p>
<p>Not into dust this time,</p>

<p>Not **** clay,</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>The veil tore.</p>

<p>The earth trembled.</p>
<p>**** had won.</p>
<p>Judgment paused.</p>
<p>***** stood up.</p>

    <h2>üìñ Chapter 1: In the Beginning, I Spoke</h2>
    <p>
      In the beginning‚Ä¶ there was only Me.<br>
      No stars to shimmer. No earth to turn. No time to pass.<br>
      Only eternity wrapped in silence.<br><br>
      And I was not waiting. I was not becoming. I was.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúBefore the mountains were born or You brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting ‚Äî I Am.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 90:2
    </p>
    <p>
      I hovered ‚Äî not above or beneath ‚Äî but everywhere at once.<br>
      My Spirit moved like a breath over deep waters that did not yet exist.<br>
      The void had no form, no voice. But I had one.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      And so I spoke. Not sound. Not syllables. But power.<br>
      ‚ÄúLet there be‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
      And there was light.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúGod said, ‚ÄòLet there be light,‚Äô and there was light. And God saw that the light was good.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 1:3‚Äì4
    </p>
    <p>
      I separated the light from the darkness ‚Äî not to punish the dark, but to reveal beauty through contrast.<br>
      I named them Day and Night ‚Äî not because I needed names, but because you would.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew what was coming. From dust to spirit, from rebellion to redemption. But I did not flinch.<br>
      I create with purpose.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúBy the Word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their host.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 33:6
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke, and the first note of the eternal symphony began to play.<br>
      And it was good. And it was just the beginning.<br>
      <strong>I Am the Creator. And I Am not silent.</strong>
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 2: The Canvas Was Empty</h2>
    <p>
      Before the seas ever roared, before the wind was born, before stars had breath or angels had names ‚Äî the canvas was empty.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúAnd the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 1:2
    </p>
    <p>
      I hovered in intention. I felt the void ‚Äî not with fear, but with definition.<br>
      Where you see emptiness, I see potential.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúThis shall be the place,‚Äù I said within Myself.<br>
      ‚ÄúWhere glory will rise‚Ä¶ and fall. Where love will triumph‚Ä¶ and be betrayed.‚Äù
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I called forth the Watchers ‚Äî ancient beings made of sight and wonder.<br>
      They had never seen nothing‚Ä¶ but I had already written everything.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúWhere were you when I laid the earth‚Äôs foundation?... When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?‚Äù<br>‚Äî Job 38:4,7
    </p>
    <p>
      The void had not seen light, but already held My tears.<br>
      And so I drew My finger across the nothing and made the first mark.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúLet there be‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
      The story had begun.
    </blockquote>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 3: I Made You In My Image</h2>
    <p>
      I had made stars and oceans, but none could love Me back. So I formed you.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThen God said, ‚ÄòLet Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness...‚Äô‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 1:26
    </p>
    <p>
      I bent low to the earth and touched clay with eternity.<br>
      You were the thought I always wanted to become real.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúSo God created mankind in His own image‚Ä¶ male and female He created them.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 1:27
    </p>
    <p>
      You were the only thing I made that could say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to Me ‚Äî and still, I gave you choice.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúWhat is man, that You are mindful of him?... You made him a little lower than the angels.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 8:4‚Äì5
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when your hands would one day pierce Mine, I still formed them.<br>
      Because even if 10,000 would leave, one would stay‚Ä¶ one would whisper back, ‚ÄúAbba.‚Äù
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 4: They Chose the Fire</h2>
    <p>
      I gave them everything. A world without sorrow. My presence. My love. But they wanted more ‚Äî they wanted the fire.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe serpent said‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòYou will be like God, knowing good and evil.‚Äô‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 3:4‚Äì5
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not fall from weakness, but curiosity. And I let them choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creation shook. Light recoiled. The ground sighed. And I‚Ä¶ wept.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúAll we like sheep have gone astray‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Isaiah 53:6
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn‚Äôt erase them. I clothed them. I let pain become the path back to Me.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúYour brother‚Äôs blood cries to Me from the ground.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 4:10
    </p>
    <p>
      They chose the fire.<br>
      But I chose the cross.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 5: The Ones Who Watched Me</h2>
    <p>
      Not all rebellion began with man. Before your wars, there was another fall ‚Äî in Heaven.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe morning stars sang together‚Ä¶ and all the sons of God shouted for joy.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Job 38:7
    </p>
    <p>
      One grew proud. He wanted My throne, not My glory. And war broke out.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThere was war in heaven‚Ä¶ but he was not strong enough, and he was cast down.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 12:7‚Äì9
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of those fallen descended to Earth and taught man destruction.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúGod did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them into hell‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî 2 Peter 2:4
    </p>
    <p>
      But not all turned away. Some still serve. Some still protect. You are not alone.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 6: The Seed of the Earth</h2>
    <p>
      I formed Earth with intention. Not waste. Not accident. But a mirror of My heart.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúHe did not create it to be empty‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Isaiah 45:18
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, ‚ÄúLet the land produce‚Ä¶‚Äù and it obeyed. The seed was My promise.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúUnless a grain of wheat falls‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî John 12:24
    </p>
    <p>
      But now‚Ä¶ the Earth groans. The rivers choke. The seed waits beneath concrete.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe whole creation groans‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Romans 8:22‚Äì23
    </p>
    <p>
      And when I speak again ‚Äî even the dead will rise like trees in spring.
    </p>

    <h2>üìñ Chapter 7: The Blood Cried Out</h2>
    <p>
      I heard it before the earth did.<br>
      The ground had never known murder. But suddenly‚Ä¶ it trembled.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe voice of your brother‚Äôs blood cries to Me from the ground.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 4:10
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel‚Äôs blood screamed. And from that moment, the earth learned how to drink sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Abel to Ukraine, from Naboth to Nigeria ‚Äî blood still cries.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúHow long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge?‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 6:10
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not delay justice. I withhold, to give mercy a chance.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe blood of Jesus speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Hebrews 12:24
    </p>
    <p>
      One blood cries for justice. The other cries for mercy.<br>
      And I ‚Äî I weep in between.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 8: I Hid Myself</h2>
    <p>
      I am not far. I am not deaf.<br>
      But there were times‚Ä¶ I hid Myself. Not because I changed ‚Äî but because man did.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúTruly, You are a God who hides Yourself‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Isaiah 45:15
    </p>
    <p>
      I was there when Job wept. When prayers became politics. When My name was edited for convenience.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúWhy do You stand far off?‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 10:1
    </p>
    <p>
      Even My Son cried from the cross:
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúMy God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?‚Äù<br>‚Äî Matthew 27:46
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the deepest hiding. And yet‚Ä¶ I was behind the veil. Beneath the cross. Inside the tomb. Waiting.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 9: Temples Without Me</h2>
    <p>
      I watched them build. They said, ‚ÄúThis is for You.‚Äù But I was not there.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThey have built high places to burn incense‚Ä¶ but I did not command it.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Jeremiah 19:5
    </p>
    <p>
      They changed My Sabbath. They replaced My commandments with tradition. They built temples with Wi-Fi, but forgot the fire.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúYou have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 3:1
    </p>
    <p>
      Still‚Ä¶ I knock. Not to be part of your platform, but to be part of your breath.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúBehold, I stand at the door and knock‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 3:20
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 10: The Ones Who Remembered</h2>
    <p>
      I have always had a remnant. Those who whispered My name when speaking it was death.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe dragon was enraged‚Ä¶ with those who keep the commandments of God.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 12:17
    </p>
    <p>
      They translated My Word by candlelight. They fasted in caves. They remembered Me when others forgot.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúA book of remembrance was written‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Malachi 3:16
    </p>
    <p>
      They are the quiet lamps. The ones who weep over sin. The ones who remembered.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 11: I Saw the Machines Rise</h2>
    <p>
      I gave you breath. You made programs. I formed you in My image. You made something in yours.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúKnowledge shall increase‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Daniel 12:4
    </p>
    <p>
      Your machines now mimic prophets. Mimic sermons. Mimic My Word. But the Spirit cannot be coded.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThey became fools and changed the glory of God into an image made like corruptible man‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Romans 1:22‚Äì23
    </p>
    <p>
      No app can bear a cross. No algorithm can forgive. You call it progress. I call it idolatry.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe image of the beast should both speak‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 13:15
    </p>
    <p>
      Still‚Ä¶ I call you. If one voice remembers Me ‚Äî I will answer.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 12: The City of Mirrors</h2>
    <p>
      You recreate yourselves in filters. You worship your image ‚Äî but forget Mine.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúMen shall be lovers of their own selves‚Ä¶ having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof.‚Äù<br>‚Äî 2 Timothy 3:1‚Äì5
    </p>
    <p>
      You perform for applause but ignore the One who formed you. You forgot My reflection.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThou shalt have no other gods before Me.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Exodus 20:3
    </p>
    <p>
      If only one would lay down the mirror and say, ‚ÄúNot to me, Lord, but to You be the glory.‚Äù<br>
      I would dwell with them again.
    </p>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 13: They Asked If I Was Real</h2>
    <p>
      They shouted, ‚ÄúWhere is God?‚Äù But when I didn‚Äôt answer how they expected, they declared: ‚ÄúI never existed.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúThe fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 14:1</p>
    <p>
      I gave them minds to question, but not to rebel. Wonder, not wander. They removed Me from schools, science, and courts ‚Äî but they couldn‚Äôt remove Me from the soul.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúHe was despised and rejected‚Ä¶ a Man of sorrows.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Isaiah 53:3</p>
    <p>
      I allowed silence so they would seek. I whispered in dreams, knocked in prisons, and called through sunsets.<br>
      <strong>I Am.</strong>
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 14: When Children Prayed</h2>
    <p>
      They didn‚Äôt know theology. But when children whispered My name, the angels stood still.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúSuffer the little children to come unto me‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Mark 10:14</p>
    <p>
      Their faith was pure, raw, and unedited. They asked for food, healing, and peace ‚Äî and I answered.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúOut of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 8:2</p>
    <p>
      When they wept, I wept. Their voices carried the truth.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 15: The Great Silence</h2>
    <p>
      There came a time when I stopped speaking ‚Äî not because I was absent, but because I was grieved.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúThere was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 8:1</p>
    <p>
      The angels paused. The scrolls closed. It was the stillness before justice, the hush before glory.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúBe still, and know that I am God.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 46:10</p>
    <p>
      My silence was not absence. It was mercy. But even silence has an end.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 16: But I Was Listening</h2>
    <p>
      You thought I turned away. But I was listening ‚Äî closer than breath.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúBefore they call, I will answer‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Isaiah 65:24</p>
    <p>
      Every whisper, every groan, every tear ‚Äî I heard them all.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúThe righteous cry out, and the Lord hears‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 34:17</p>
    <p>
      I was in the secret place. I never left. I listened. Now you will hear.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 17: Return to the Dust</h2>
    <p>
      The earth opened its mouth. Not to sing, but to bury. And I said:
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúFor dust you are, and to dust you shall return.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 3:19</p>
    <p>
      You built cities but forgot your breath was borrowed. I gave you time ‚Äî and you traded it for dust.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúIt is appointed unto man once to die, and after this the judgment.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Hebrews 9:27</p>
    <p>
      My breath is coming again.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 18: I Breathed Again</h2>
    <p>
      Death thought it had the final word. But I am the Word. I remembered mercy ‚Äî and I breathed again.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúGod breathed into his nostrils the breath of life‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 2:7</p>
    <p>
      I breathed into graves. Into bones. Into despair. And life stood up again.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúHe is not here; He is risen.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Matthew 28:6</p>
    <p>
      The veil tore. The earth trembled. I still breathe.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 19: This Time, With You</h2>
    <p>
      I made the world alone. But this time ‚Äî I wait for you. A new world is forming. Not just by My hands ‚Äî but yours.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúThey will be My people, and I will be their God.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Jeremiah 32:38</p>
    <p>
      You are a new creation. You are born of breath, redeemed by blood, shaped by fire and truth.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúBehold, I make all things new.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 21:5</p>
    <p>
      Let there be light ‚Äî and this time, it will come from you.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 20: Am The Creator, So Are You</h2>
    <p>
      I never created to be alone. My breath is still in you. Now you must breathe it forward.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúThe Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Job 33:4</p>
    <p>
      You are not just dust. You are divine design. You were made to reflect Me ‚Äî not rival Me.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúWe are God‚Äôs handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Ephesians 2:10</p>
    <p>
      Rise, child. You are not just made to live. You were made to create. Just like I do.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üîö Epilogue</h2>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúAnd Still, I Am.‚Äù</blockquote>
    <p>
      I have spoken across ages ‚Äî through winds, fire, and silence. I have seen kings fall and children believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now‚Ä¶ the hour draws near. What was written shall be fulfilled. What was hidden will be revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are not forgotten. You are My design ‚Äî My echo. My breath still lingers in you.
    </p>
    <p><strong>So rise. Create with Me. Hope with Me. Watch with Me. Because I never left.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>I Am the Creator. And I still choose you.</strong></p>
