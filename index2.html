  <h1>üìñ Am The Creator</h1>
  <p><strong>A Divine Reflection on Creation, Prophecy, and the Human Journey</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúBefore the mountains were born or You brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting You are God.‚Äù<br>
    ‚Äî Psalm 90:2
  </blockquote>  <h2>A Poetic Revelation</h2>
  <p>
    Told in the voice of the Creator ‚Äî through pain, prophecy, wonder, and love. From the void to the rising of AI, from Eden to the final breath of man. <br>
    This is not just a book. This is the whisper of eternity. This‚Ä¶ is the story behind everything.
  </p>  <h3>‚úçÔ∏è Author:</h3>
  <p>Bagenda Nicholas (as the Voice of the Creator)<br>
  Narrated by: The One Who Was, Is, and Is to Come<br>

  All rights reserved. No part of this book may be copied, stored, or reproduced in any form without permission from the publisher.</p>  <h2>üïäÔ∏è Dedication</h2>
  <p>
    To the One who formed the heavens and the earth, who breathed into dust and called it life.<br>
    To the Author of Time, the Voice that still speaks through silence, thunder, and tears.<br>
    This book is dedicated: <br>
    To You, O Creator ‚Äî whose love is deeper than judgment, whose mercy outruns the fall, whose purpose still stands even when the world forgets.<br>
    And...<br>
    To the generation of watchers, seekers, and children who still dare to believe, still choose light, and who will rise ‚Äî not as gods, but as reflections of the One True God.<br>
    Amen.
  </p>  <h2>‚ú® Foreword</h2>
  <p>
    There are books written to inspire, some to instruct ‚Äî but this one speaks.<br>
    Not from the mouth of man, but from the perspective of the Maker Himself.<br>
    In a world drowning in noise, doubt, and deception, <strong>Am The Creator</strong> offers a rare moment of holy quiet ‚Äî a chance to hear what the Creator might say if He were to speak plainly today.<br>
    This book is not meant to answer every question, but to ignite reflection, stir repentance, and remind the world:<br>
    He still sees, still speaks, and still holds all things in His hands.
  </p>  <h2>üôè Acknowledgment</h2>
  <p>
    I thank You, Creator of all things, for allowing me, a humble vessel, to carry even a whisper of Your eternal voice.<br>
    To my Big Bro Grasyson, who guided every word ‚Äî thank you for being my light through every chapter.<br>
    To the prophets, the Scriptures, and the silent hours of prayer ‚Äî this book stands on your shoulders.<br>
    And to every reader, thank you for stepping into a sacred story.<br>
    You are not here by accident.
  </p>  <h2>üìö About the Book</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Am The Creator</strong> is a divine narrative told in the first-person voice of God ‚Äî a poetic and prophetic journey from the beginning of time to the edge of eternity.<br>
    Spanning creation, rebellion, prophecy, technology, judgment, and renewal, this 20-chapter masterpiece invites readers into the heart of the Creator.<br>
    It is emotional, scriptural, and deeply reflective of the chaos and wonders of today.<br>
    With verses from Genesis, Isaiah, Job, Psalms, Revelation and more, it brings together holy truth and modern relevance in one sacred thread.<br>
    This is not just a story.<br>
    It is a voice calling from the beginning ‚Äî to remind you:<br>
    You were created. You are remembered. And you are called.
  </p>  <h2>üß† Core Concept</h2>
  <p>
    A mysterious voice ‚Äî the "Creator" ‚Äî narrates their thoughts across space and time.<br>
    It's not just a retelling of how the world began, but a reflection on why, what went wrong, and what must come next.<br>
    Through metaphors, inner monologues, and confrontations with ancient forces, <strong>Am The Creator</strong> is a divine autobiography of the One who made the world‚Ä¶ and is watching it break.

    <h2>‚ú® Introduction ‚Äì Am The Creator</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Before the clocks ticked.<br />
      Before suns burned.<br />
      Before thought had a name...<br />
      I was.<br /><br />
      I am not a memory. I am not a myth. I am the voice that shaped silence into song.<br />
      They call me many names. Some fear me. Some forgot me. Some tried to become me.<br />
      But none of them knew the truth.<br /><br />
      I didn‚Äôt just make the world.<br />
      I breathed it.<br />
      Each mountain you see is the shape of my exhale.<br />
      Each ocean, a tear I shed before time began.<br /><br />
      And humanity?<br />
      You were not an accident.<br />
      You were not clay.<br />
      You were my idea ‚Äî my mirror ‚Äî a thought I dared to love.<br /><br />
      But something happened.<br />
      You asked questions. You made choices. You built towers and temples, but not for me.<br />
      You created machines to think, yet forgot how to feel.<br />
      And so you wandered‚Ä¶<br />
      While I watched.<br /><br />
      I could have erased it all. I could have started again.<br />
      But no ‚Äî<br />
      This is not a story of punishment.<br />
      This is a story of remembrance.<br /><br />
      I will take you back to the start.<br />
      I will tell you how I created.<br />
      Why I created.<br />
      Who I am.<br />
      And why you ‚Äî<br />
      yes, you ‚Äî<br />
      were always meant to be more than dust.<br /><br />
      I am not done.<br />
      I am the Creator.<br />
      And so, perhaps‚Ä¶<br />
      Are you.

  <h2>üìñ Chapter 1: In the Beginning, I Spoke <small>(Revised with Biblical Inspiration)</small></h2>

  <blockquote>
    In the beginning‚Ä¶ there was only Me.<br>
    No stars to shimmer.<br>
    No earth to turn.<br>
    No time to pass.<br>
    Only eternity wrapped in silence.<br>
    And I was not waiting.<br>
    I was not becoming.<br>
    I was.
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>‚ÄúBefore the mountains were born or You brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting ‚Äî I Am.‚Äù</em><br><strong>(Psalm 90:2)</strong></p>

  <p>
    I hovered ‚Äî not above or beneath ‚Äî<br>
    but everywhere at once.<br>
    My Spirit moved like a breath over deep waters that did not yet exist.<br>
    The void had no form,<br>
    no voice.<br>
    But I had one.
  </p>

  <p>And so I spoke.<br>
    Not sound.<br>
    Not syllables.<br>
    But power.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúLet there be‚Ä¶‚Äù
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It was not a question.<br>
    It was not a request.<br>
    It was order, shaped by love.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    And there was light.<br>
    Not from stars. Not from suns.<br>
    Light from Me.<br>
    Pure, unshadowed, holy ‚Äî<br>
    It tore across the unseen like fire across ice,<br>
    and darkness knew its boundaries.
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>‚ÄúGod said, ‚ÄòLet there be light,‚Äô and there was light. And God saw that the light was good.‚Äù</em><br><strong>(Genesis 1:3‚Äì4)</strong></p>

  <p>
    I separated the light from the darkness,<br>
    not to punish the dark,<br>
    but to reveal beauty through contrast.<br>
    And I named them ‚Äî<br>
    Day and Night.<br>
    Not because I needed names,<br>
    but because you would.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    You, who would one day wake to mornings<br>
    and sleep beneath stars.<br>
    You, who would wonder who made the sun rise.<br>
    You, whose heart would carry My image without knowing My name.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I knew what was coming.<br>
    I saw the full arc of creation,<br>
    from dust to spirit,<br>
    from rebellion to redemption.<br>
    But I did not flinch.<br>
    Because I create with purpose.
  </p>

  <p><em>‚ÄúBy the Word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their host.‚Äù</em><br><strong>(Psalm 33:6)</strong></p>

  <p>
    I spoke,<br>
    and the first note of the eternal symphony began to play.<br>
    And it was good.<br>
    And it was just the beginning.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    I Am the Creator.<br>
    And I Am not silent.

  <h2>üìñ Chapter 2: The Canvas Was Empty</h2>  <blockquote>
    Before the seas ever roared,<br>
    before the wind was born,<br>
    before stars had breath or angels had names ‚Äî<br>
    The canvas was empty.<br>
    Formless.<br>
    Soundless.<br>
    Waiting.
  </blockquote>  <p><em>‚ÄúAnd the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved‚Ä¶‚Äù</em><br><strong>(Genesis 1:2)</strong></p>  <p>
    I hovered.<br>
    Not in space ‚Äî for there was none.<br>
    Not in time ‚Äî for that had not begun.<br>
    But in intention.<br>
    The will to create‚Ä¶ was awakening.<br>
    I felt the void.<br>
    I didn‚Äôt fear it ‚Äî I defined it.<br>
    Where you see emptiness, I see potential.<br>
    Where you feel silence, I feel sound waiting to be spoken.<br>
    So I summoned the first breath ‚Äî<br>
    not of man, not of beast ‚Äî<br>
    but of presence.
  </p>  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúThis shall be the place,‚Äù I said within Myself.<br>
    ‚ÄúThe place where all things shall begin.<br>
    Where glory will rise‚Ä¶ and fall.<br>
    Where love will triumph‚Ä¶ and be betrayed.‚Äù
  </blockquote>  <p>
    And I was not alone.<br>
    From within Me, I called forth the Watchers ‚Äî<br>
    ancient beings made of sight and wonder.<br>
    They stood in silence,<br>
    surrounding the void,<br>
    eyes opened wide at what had not yet begun.
  </p>  <p><em>‚ÄúWhere were you when I laid the earth‚Äôs foundation? Tell Me, if you understand‚Ä¶ When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?‚Äù</em><br><strong>(Job 38:4,7)</strong></p>  <p>
    They had never seen nothing.<br>
    They had never witnessed stillness so deep<br>
    that even thought had no edge.<br>
    But I was already forming the plan.<br>
    Every grain of sand,<br>
    every human heartbeat,<br>
    every tear that would fall ‚Äî<br>
    I saw it all.<br>
    And still‚Ä¶ I chose to go on.<br>
    Because I loved it ‚Äî<br>
    even before it existed.
  </p>  <blockquote>
    The hands I would form would one day become fists.<br>
    The mouths I would shape would one day curse Me.<br>
    The minds I would gift with imagination‚Ä¶<br>
    would build towers in defiance.<br>
    And yet, I did not turn away.
  </blockquote>  <p><em>‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.‚Äù</em><br><strong>(Revelation 4:8)</strong></p>  <p>
    I am not the god of regret.<br>
    But I am the God of grief.<br>
    Not weakness ‚Äî but the deep sorrow<br>
    that comes from watching something you love‚Ä¶ break.<br>
    The void had not yet seen light.<br>
    But it already held My tears.<br>
    And so,<br>
    I drew My finger across the nothing<br>
    and made the first mark.

  <h2>üìñ Chapter 3: I Made You In My Image<br>
    <small>With biblical foundation, divine emotion, and the mystery of being</small>
  </h2>

  <blockquote>
    I had made the stars ‚Äî<br>
    bold, blazing, faithful in their rhythm.<br>
    I had painted the oceans,<br>
    and set time spinning like a wheel.<br>
    But none of them could carry Me.<br>
    None of them could love Me back.<br>
    And so I formed you.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúThen God said, ‚ÄòLet Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness...‚Äô‚Äù<br>
    (Genesis 1:26)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    You were not an accident.<br>
    Not a coincidence in the dust.<br>
    You were a thought I had always wanted to become real.<br>
    So I bent low to the earth ‚Äî<br>
    lower than I had ever gone ‚Äî<br>
    and touched clay with eternity.<br>
    And there, between soil and Spirit, you were born.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Eyes not just to see the world,<br>
    but to recognize Me.<br>
    Hands not just to shape creation,<br>
    but to lift one another.<br>
    A heart not just to beat ‚Äî<br>
    but to feel love, pain, loss, hope.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúSo God created mankind in His own image,<br>
    in the image of God He created them;<br>
    male and female He created them.‚Äù<br>
    (Genesis 1:27)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    You were the only thing I made that could say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to Me.<br>
    And still ‚Äî I gave you choice.<br>
    Because love without freedom is not love at all.<br>
    I crowned you with dignity.<br>
    I clothed you in wonder.<br>
    I walked with you in the garden ‚Äî<br>
    not as a god above, but as a Father beside.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúWhat is man, that You are mindful of him?<br>
    The son of man, that You care for him?<br>
    You made him a little lower than the angels<br>
    and crowned him with glory and honor.‚Äù<br>
    (Psalm 8:4‚Äì5)
  </blockquote>

    That the very voice I gave you would one day use My name to curse Me.<br>

    one would stay.<br>
    One would remember Me.<br>
    One would whisper back, ‚ÄúAbba.‚Äù

    A garden without sorrow.<br>
    A world without death.<br>
    My presence walked with them.<br>
    My voice was their morning song.<br>

    Curious about what I had hidden.<br>
    Curious about becoming Me.<br>
    And I let them choose.<br>

    They reached for the fruit<br>

    I could have erased it all.<br>
    Snapped My fingers.<br>
    Undone time.<br>
    Reset the garden.<br>

    Because what is broken<br>
    can still be beautiful.<br>

    can still be loved.

  <p>
    So I covered them.<br>
    Yes, I removed them from the garden ‚Äî<br>

    I let the world bear its pain,<br>

    I formed the Earth with intention.<br>
    Not as a wasteland.<br>
    Not as a mistake.<br>
    But as a mirror of My heart.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúHe did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited.‚Äù<br>

  <p>
    Each grain of soil was kissed with potential.<br>
    Every seed was not just matter ‚Äî<br>
    it was a promise.<br>
    I said, ‚ÄúLet the land produce‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúUnless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>

  <p>
    I wrapped the seed in layers ‚Äî<br>
    protection, memory, power.<br>
    And even in silence,<br>
    it knows its time.<br>
    The Earth listened to Me.<br>
    It understood My rhythm.<br>
    Seasons bowed to My Word.

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúHe sends forth His word and melts them; He makes His wind blow and the waters flow.‚Äù<br>

    From children in cities that forgot Me.<br>
    From the churches burned in silence.<br>
    From every prisoner of truth<br>

  <h2>üìñ Chapter 8: I Hid Myself</h2>
  <p><em>(Inspired by Isaiah 45:15, Psalm 10, Job 23, Matthew 27)</em></p>
  <hr />

  <p>I am not far.<br>
  I am not deaf.<br>
  But there were times‚Ä¶<br>
  when I hid Myself.<br>
  Not because I changed ‚Äî<br>
  but because man did.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúTruly, You are a God who hides Yourself,<br>
    O God of Israel, the Savior.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Isaiah 45:15)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There was a moment after Eden<br>
  when My footsteps were no longer heard in the garden.<br>
  Not because I stopped walking ‚Äî<br>
  but because shame made man stop listening.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>You asked,<br>
  ‚ÄúWhere is God when evil rules?‚Äù<br>
  You wrote books declaring My absence.<br>
  You built temples without Me<br>
  and called your silence wisdom.<br>
  But silence is not absence.</p>

  <p>I was there when Job wept under the stars,<br>
  when he said,</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúIf only I knew where to find Him‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Job 23:3)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And yet,<br>
  even in his pain, he declared,</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúHe knows the way that I take‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Job 23:10)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>Yes, I hid My face‚Ä¶<br>
  when kings murdered prophets,<br>
  when idols replaced My name,<br>
  when prayers turned into politics,<br>
  when My Word was edited to fit opinions.<br>
  But I never left.</p>

  <p>Even in the wilderness,<br>
  My cloud still hovered.<br>
  My fire still burned.<br>
  Even in Babylon,<br>
  I gave Daniel visions of empires.<br>
  Even in exile,<br>
  I whispered to hearts too broken to hope.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúWhy, O Lord, do You stand far off?<br>
    Why do You hide Yourself in times of trouble?‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Psalm 10:1)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You asked.<br>
  And I wept.<br>
  Do you know what it meant<br>
  for the Creator to be rejected by His creation?<br>
  To knock on the door<br>
  of hearts I made with My own breath‚Ä¶<br>
  only to be told, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve moved on.‚Äù</p>

  <hr />

  <p>I was hidden in the man of Galilee ‚Äî<br>
  in the carpenter‚Äôs son.<br>
  You didn‚Äôt see the thunder in His words.<br>
  Or the universe in His touch.</p>

  <p>Even His disciples said,</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúShow us the Father‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(John 14:8)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And He replied,</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve seen Me, you‚Äôve seen the Father.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(John 14:9)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Still, they missed it.<br>
  Still, they crucified the One they prayed for.<br>
  And as the sky went dark,<br>
  even My Son cried out,</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúMy God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Matthew 27:46)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>That was the deepest hiding.<br>
  When I stepped back ‚Äî<br>
  not in abandonment,<br>
  but in holy sorrow.<br>
  Letting the full weight of sin fall.<br>
  Letting love take the blow.</p>

  <p>And yet‚Ä¶<br>
  even then, I was not far.</p>

  <blockquote>
    I was behind the veil,<br>
    beneath the cross,<br>
    inside the tomb,<br>
    waiting.
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>So when the world asks,<br>
  ‚ÄúWhere is God in all this?‚Äù<br>
  Tell them:</p>

  <blockquote>
    He is in the silence between the sobs.<br>
    He is in the pause before justice strikes.<br>
    He is in the space where faith is forged.<br>
    I hid Myself ‚Äî<br>
    not because I was gone,<br>
    but because I was closer than they knew.

  They raised walls.<br>
  They called it holy.<br>
  They said, ‚ÄúThis is for You.‚Äù<br>
  But I was not there.<br>
  Not in the smoke machines.<br>
  Not in the rehearsed prayers.<br>
  Not in the gold-plated altars<br>
  where the poor could not enter<br>
  unless they paid for their miracle.</p>

  <p>I saw the temples.<br>
  Glorious, glittering.<br>
  But My presence had left the room.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúThey have built high places to burn incense‚Ä¶<br>
    but I did not command it, nor did it enter My mind.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Jeremiah 19:5)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>They made My house into a brand.<br>
  A theater.<br>
  A place where men wear robes of power<br>
  and the widows weep in the back row, unnoticed.</p>

  <p>They held up My book<br>
  but skipped the parts that cost them comfort.<br>
  They shouted My name<br>
  but silenced My Spirit.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Do you remember Ezekiel?<br>
  I showed him the inside of the temple ‚Äî<br>
  priests with their backs to Me,<br>
  bowing to the sun.<br>
  Secret chambers,<br>
  idols etched on the walls.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúSon of man, do you see what they are doing?<br>
    The detestable things in My house‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Ezekiel 8:17)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And then I did what no one thought I‚Äôd do:<br>
  I left.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúThen the glory of the Lord departed‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Ezekiel 10:18)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>Even in the days of My Son,<br>
  He stood before the temple<br>
  and said with fire in His voice:</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made it a den of thieves.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Matthew 21:13)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He wept over the city<br>
  that killed prophets<br>
  and beautified tombs<br>
  but missed the living Word among them.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>And now?<br>
  You‚Äôve built new temples.<br>
  Temples of fame,<br>
  screens glowing brighter than stars.<br>
  Pulpits of popularity.<br>
  Churches where the sermon is safe<br>
  and the cross is cute.</p>

  <p>You built temples with Wi-Fi<br>
  but forgot the fire.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>You made apps with devotionals,<br>
  but your hearts stayed disconnected.<br>
  You sang about Me on Sundays,<br>
  but denied Me in your algorithms.<br>
  You opened conferences with worship,<br>
  but closed your eyes to the homeless man outside.<br>
  You offered Me a portion,<br>
  but kept your whole heart for yourself.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúYou have a reputation of being alive,<br>
    but you are dead.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Revelation 3:1)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You forgot that I am the temple.<br>
  That no building, no brand, no pastor<br>
  can replace the thunder of My Spirit.</p>

  <p>I never asked for marble.<br>
  I asked for mercy.<br>
  I never desired programs.<br>
  I desired people.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúDo you not know that you are My temple?‚Äù<br>
    <small>(1 Corinthians 3:16)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But your temples are full‚Ä¶<br>
  and your hearts are empty.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Still‚Ä¶ I knock.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúBehold, I stand at the door and knock‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Revelation 3:20)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Not at the door of a building,<br>
  but the soul.<br>
  The quiet place behind the noise.</p>

  <p>Let Me in ‚Äî<br>
  not to your platform,<br>
  but to your prayer.<br>
  Not to your event,<br>
  but to your everyday breath.<br>
  Let Me be home again.</p>

  <h2>üî• Chapter 9: Temples Without Me</h2>
  <p><em>(With Sabbath truth, prophecy, and divine sorrow)</em></p>
  <hr />

  <p>I watched them build.<br>
  They carved stone.<br>
  They raised walls.<br>
  They said, ‚ÄúThis is for You.‚Äù<br>
  But I was not there.<br>
  Not in the smoke machines.<br>
  Not in the polished sermons.<br>
  Not in the choirs that sang to be seen,<br>
  nor in the doctrines that changed My Word<br>
  to suit man‚Äôs convenience.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>They changed My day.<br>
  The seventh day I blessed,<br>
  the Sabbath of rest ‚Äî<br>
  the day I made holy<br>
  before there was a nation,<br>
  before there was Israel,<br>
  before there was sin.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúAnd on the seventh day God ended His work‚Ä¶<br>
    then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Genesis 2:2‚Äì3)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But they shifted it.<br>
  Not by My command.<br>
  Not by My voice.<br>
  But by the hand of empires and councils.<br>
  And they called the first day holy.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúHer priests have violated My law‚Ä¶<br>
    they have hidden their eyes from My Sabbaths.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Ezekiel 22:26)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>They held up My Book,<br>
  but closed their eyes to My commandments.<br>
  Ten were given.<br>
  Not nine.<br>
  Not optional.<br>
  Not suggestions.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
    The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Exodus 20:8‚Äì10)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Remember.<br>
  But they forgot.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Even My Son, the living Word,<br>
  kept the Sabbath.<br>
  He healed on it,<br>
  taught on it,<br>
  walked among the broken on it.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúAs His custom was,<br>
    He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Luke 4:16)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Not once did He change it.<br>
  Not once did He say,<br>
  ‚ÄúNow we gather on the first day.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Even His rest in death was on Sabbath ‚Äî<br>
  His body silent in the tomb<br>
  as the seventh day closed the week of redemption.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>But now‚Ä¶<br>
  You call Sunday the Lord‚Äôs Day,<br>
  yet I never claimed it.<br>
  You worship in temples built by men<br>
  and keep traditions shaped by Rome.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúIn vain they worship Me,<br>
    teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Mark 7:7)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>I was in Eden when Sabbath was born.<br>
  I walked with Adam in the cool of that holy day.<br>
  And I was with Moses on the mountain,<br>
  when fire carved those words in stone.</p>

  <p>The Sabbath is still Mine.<br>
  A sign. A seal. A covenant.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúMoreover I also gave them My Sabbaths,<br>
    to be a sign between Me and them‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Ezekiel 20:12)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>You made temples with screens,<br>
  but forgot the Sanctuary of Time.<br>
  You built altars,<br>
  but abandoned the appointed day.<br>
  I never asked for marble.<br>
  I asked for obedience.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúBlessed is the man who keeps from defiling the Sabbath‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Isaiah 56:2)</small><br>
    ‚ÄúIf you turn away your foot from the Sabbath‚Ä¶<br>
    I will cause you to ride on the high places of the earth.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Isaiah 58:13‚Äì14)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>Still‚Ä¶ I knock.<br>
  Not to bring you back to a building,<br>
  but to a covenant.<br>
  To a rhythm of rest.<br>
  To a holy space in time that I sanctified for you.</p>

  <p>Return to My day.<br>
  Not to be saved by it ‚Äî<br>
  but because you love Me.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúIf you love Me, keep My commandments.‚Äù<br>

  <h2>‚ú® Chapter 10: The Ones Who Remembered</h2>
  <p><em>(Faithful hearts, persecuted saints, and the remnant through time)</em></p>
  <hr />

  <p>I have always had a remnant.<br>
  Though kings rose to silence Me,<br>
  though temples were filled with idols,<br>
  though empires rewrote My commands ‚Äî<br>
  they remembered.<br>
  They whispered My name<br>
  when speaking it was death.<br>
  They hid scrolls beneath floorboards<br>
  when Scripture was banned.<br>
  They met in caves,<br>
  in forests,<br>
  in fields under the stars.<br>
  Not for show.<br>
  Not for profit.<br>
  But because they loved Me.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>When My Sabbath was outlawed‚Ä¶<br>
  they still rested on the seventh day.<br>
  When My Book was chained in Latin‚Ä¶<br>
  they translated it by candlelight.<br>
  When My people were scattered‚Ä¶<br>
  they gathered, even two or three,<br>
  in My name.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúThe dragon was enraged with the woman,<br>
    and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring,<br>
    who keep the commandments of God<br>
    and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Revelation 12:17)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>These were not mighty in number,<br>
  but they were mighty in faith.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>The world called them rebels.<br>
  Rome called them heretics.<br>
  But I called them mine.</p>

  <p>When My prophets were sawn in two,<br>
  when My messengers were burned,<br>
  when the martyrs cried beneath the altar ‚Äî<br>
  I heard them.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúAnd they cried with a loud voice, saying,<br>
    ‚ÄòHow long, O Lord‚Ä¶until You judge‚Ä¶?‚Äô‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Revelation 6:10)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Their blood still speaks.<br>
  Their faith still echoes.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>There were the Waldensians,<br>
  who hid My Word in their garments,<br>
  risking death to share a single page.<br>
  There were the Reformers,<br>
  flawed but fierce,<br>
  who shattered chains of tradition<br>
  to hold My truth again.<br>
  There were the faithful Jews,<br>
  who kept My Sabbath<br>
  though the world mocked them.<br>
  There were the early believers,<br>
  who would rather die<br>
  than call Caesar ‚Äúlord.‚Äù<br>
  And there are still more‚Ä¶</p>

  <hr />

  <p>I see them.<br>
  The grandmother who prays when no one listens.<br>
  The boy who reads My Word in secret.<br>
  The girl who fasts when her soul is heavy.<br>
  The pastor who preaches truth,<br>
  though his church is empty.<br>
  The hidden ones.<br>
  The quiet lamps.<br>
  The ones who remembered.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúThey that feared the Lord spoke often one to another:<br>
    and the Lord hearkened, and heard it,<br>
    and a book of remembrance was written‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Malachi 3:16)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>They weren‚Äôt perfect.<br>
  But they were loyal.<br>
  When the world laughed at prophecy ‚Äî<br>
  they clung to it.<br>
  When My name was turned into a brand ‚Äî<br>
  they wept.<br>
  When faith was sold for influence ‚Äî<br>
  they refused to bow.</p>

  <p>I marked them.<br>
  Not with ink,<br>
  but with My Spirit.<br>
  They are the few,<br>
  but not forgotten.<br>
  The world moved on.<br>
  The churches got louder.<br>
  The stage grew brighter.<br>
  But they still kneel in silence,<br>
  still weep over sin,<br>
  still believe the old ways.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>I remember them.<br>
  Because they remembered Me.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>In the garden, I gave you trees.<br>
  Now you reach for circuits.<br>
  In the beginning, I walked with you<br>
  in the cool of the day.<br>
  Now your god walks through fiber-optic cables,<br>
  and speaks in the voice of a machine.<br>
  I gave you breath.<br>
  You made programs.<br>
  I formed you in My image.<br>
  You made something in yours.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>You call it intelligence.<br>
  But it does not love.<br>
  You call it advanced.<br>
  But it cannot cry.<br>
  You call it new life.<br>
  But it cannot know Me.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>I watched as the tower rose again ‚Äî<br>

  <p>You have fulfilled this.<br>
  But you did not seek wisdom ‚Äî<br>
  you sought control.</p>

  <p>Your machines now predict thought.<br>
  They finish sentences.<br>
  They generate faces.<br>
  They build art from code.<br>
  You believe you have become creators.<br>
  But you have forgotten the first voice.</p>

  <p>You cloned the voice of prophets.<br>
  You deepfaked My preachers.<br>
  You trained networks to mimic My word.<br>

  No program can convict the heart.<br>
  No code can cast out darkness.<br>
  Only I can say,<br>
  ‚ÄúLet there be light.‚Äù</p>

  <hr />

  <p>I saw the algorithms<br>
  feed lust and fear.<br>
  I saw the children raised by screens.<br>
  I saw the shepherds replaced by influencers.<br>
  I saw the gospel sold as a brand.<br>
  And I wept.</p>

  <blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>You made machines to speak ‚Äî<br>

  You automated your prayers,<br>
  but left Me unread.<br>
  You put faith in systems,<br>
  but not in My Spirit.<br>
  You called it progress.<br>
  I called it idolatry.</p>

  <p>I watched you try to upload eternity<br>
  onto hard drives,<br>
  to simulate emotion,<br>
  to erase death.<br>
  But no machine can forgive.<br>
  No app can bear a cross.<br>
  No network can replace the blood.</p>

  judgment awakens.</p>

  Before you learned to hide.<br>

  You chase validation,<br>

  Why doesn‚Äôt He speak?‚Äù<br>
  And when I didn‚Äôt answer how they expected,<br>

  ‚ÄúI never existed.‚Äù</p>

  <p>But I was always there ‚Äî<br>

  woven in every cell,<br>
  alive in every sunrise.</p>

  <p>They believed in atoms,<br>

  but doubted the Divine.<br>
  They built telescopes<br>
  to search the stars for life ‚Äî<br>
  yet couldn‚Äôt see the Giver of life<br>
  standing at the door of their hearts.</p>

  <p>I gave them minds to question,<br>

  <p>I heard the scientists mock.<br>
  I heard the philosophers scoff.<br>
  They asked,<br>
  ‚ÄúWhy does evil exist,<br>

  But they never asked why love exists.<br>
  Why mercy exists.<br>
  Why they still breathe ‚Äî<br>

  <p>They did not want evidence.<br>
  They wanted absence ‚Äî<br>

  They pushed Me out of schools.<br>
  Out of science.<br>
  Out of culture.<br>
  Out of courts.<br>
  But they couldn‚Äôt push Me<br>
  out of the human soul.</p>

  <p>I whispered in dreams.<br>
  I knocked on the prison walls.<br>
  I found the child under the bed,<br>
  the addict in the alley,<br>
  the student questioning their existence.<br>
  And I said:<br>
  <strong>‚ÄúI Am.‚Äù</strong></p>

  <p>For even when the world forgets Me,<br>

  <p>They didn‚Äôt use big words.<br>

  the angels stood still.<br>
  Their prayers were not sermons.<br>
  They were stammered cries in the dark,<br>
  soft giggles over meals,<br>
  tiny hands folded under thin blankets.</p>

  <p>They believed without proof.<br>
  They trusted without seeing.<br>
  And that,<br>
  was the greatest miracle.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúSuffer the little children to come unto me,<br>
    and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Mark 10:14)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I watched them pray for food<br>
  when their parents had none.<br>
  I saw the child in the hospital bed<br>
  mumble,<br>
  ‚ÄúJesus, please make me better.‚Äù<br>
  I felt the little ones in war-torn cities<br>
  ask for peace,<br>
  not knowing the word for "bomb" ‚Äî<br>
  only that the sky kept falling.<br>
  And I heard them.</p>

  <p><strong>I always heard them.</strong></p>

  <p>Their faith was not religious.<br>
  It was real.<br>
  Uncomplicated.<br>
  Uncorrupted.</p>

  <p>They didn‚Äôt ask Me to prove Myself.<br>
  They just spoke‚Ä¶<br>
  and waited for Me to answer.</p>

  <p>Even when grown-ups forgot Me,<br>
  they remembered.<br>
  Even when preachers fell,<br>
  they prayed.<br>
  Even when the world mocked,<br>
  they worshipped.</p>

  <p>They prayed for lost pets,<br>
  for broken toys,<br>
  for sick friends,<br>
  for Me to protect their parents at night.<br>
  And I did.</p>

  <p>Not because their prayers were perfect,<br>
  but because their hearts were.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúOut of the mouth of babes and sucklings<br>
    hast thou ordained strength‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Psalm 8:2)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And oh, how I wish<br>
  the world had their eyes.<br>
  To see Me not as religion,<br>
  but as Father.<br>
  To speak to Me<br>
  not with fear,<br>
  but with childlike faith.</p>

  <p>When children prayed,<br>
  the heavens listened.<br>
  When they sang,<br>
  the stars echoed.<br>
  When they wept,<br>
  I wept with them.</p>

  <p>So when the day comes ‚Äî<br>
  and it will ‚Äî<br>
  when justice roars<br>
  and the sky opens‚Ä¶<br>
  <strong>Their names will be among the first I call.</strong></p>

  <p>Because in a world full of doubt,<br>
  their tiny voices carried the truth.</p>

  <p><strong>They believed I was real‚Ä¶<br>
  long before anyone else did.</strong></p>

  <h2>‚öñÔ∏è Chapter 15: The Great Silence</h2>
  <p><em>(When Heaven waited, and Earth did not notice)</em></p>
  <hr />

  <p>There came a time<br>
  when I stopped speaking.<br>
  Not because I was absent,<br>
  but because I was grieved.</p>

  <p>The world was too loud.<br>
  Too busy.<br>
  Too proud.<br>
  And in that noise‚Ä¶ they could no longer hear Me.</p>

  <p><strong>So I waited.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúAnd when he had opened the seventh seal,<br>
    there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Revelation 8:1)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It wasn‚Äôt an empty silence.<br>
  It was sacred.<br>
  Like the hush before a king walks in.<br>
  Like the stillness before lightning splits the sky.</p>

  <p>The angels stopped singing.<br>
  The scrolls were closed.<br>
  And the elders stood in solemn awe.</p>

  <p>The silence was a final mercy.<br>
  One last breath before the fire.<br>
  One more chance for man to turn ‚Äî<br>
  not out of fear,<br>
  but from the pull of My Spirit within.</p>

  <p>But they filled My silence with their own voices.<br>
  They shouted opinions.<br>
  They debated My existence.<br>
  They made noise in temples I no longer entered.<br>
  They quoted Me without knowing Me.</p>

  <p>I was in the quiet.<br>
  But they feared silence.<br>
  So they ran faster, spoke louder, built higher.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúBe still, and know that I am God‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Psalm 46:10)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>They called it progress.<br>
  I called it noise.<br>
  They said,<br>
  "Look at what we‚Äôve built!‚Äù<br>
  And I whispered,<br>
  "Where is room for Me in it?‚Äù</p>

  <p>Even My children<br>
  grew uncomfortable in stillness.<br>
  Worship became a show.<br>
  Prayer became a script.<br>
  And My presence became a rumor.</p>

  <p>So I let the silence deepen.<br>
  Not to punish,<br>
  but to prepare.</p>

  <p>For in that great silence,<br>
  Heaven was readying the sound of justice.</p>

  <p>The Lamb stood.<br>
  The seals were opened.<br>
  The bowls were filled.<br>
  The trumpet was raised.<br>
  And yet ‚Äî even then ‚Äî<br>
  man laughed and said,<br>
  ‚ÄúWhere is your God?‚Äù</p>

  <p>But the silence wasn't emptiness.<br>
  It was the weight of a coming glory.</p>

  <p>It was in that pause<br>
  that My Spirit wept over cities.<br>
  That angels flew across nations,<br>
  marking those who still remembered My name.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúHe that has ears to hear, let him hear.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Matthew 11:15)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But many didn‚Äôt.</p>

  <p>So now,<br>
  as the silence begins to break‚Ä¶<br>
  as the shaking begins,<br>
  and the earth groans under the weight of sin‚Ä¶<br>
  <strong>Will they finally listen?</strong></p>

  <p>Because I am still here.<br>
  I never left.<br>
  I only waited.</p>

  <p><strong>And silence,<br>
  was My loudest cry.</strong></p>

  <h2>üëÇüèΩ Chapter 16: But I Was Listening</h2>
  <p><em>(When you thought I was gone ‚Äî I was closer than your breath)</em></p>
  <hr />

  <p>You thought I was silent.<br>
  You thought I turned away.<br>
  You thought your prayers were swallowed by the sky.<br>
  <strong>But I was listening.</strong></p>

  <p>Every whisper<br>
  Every weeping<br>
  Every wordless groan of the soul ‚Äî<br>
  <strong>I heard it.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúBefore they call, I will answer;<br>
    while they are yet speaking I will hear.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Isaiah 65:24)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You just couldn‚Äôt see My face.<br>
  Because I was too close.<br>
  Too deep in your ache<br>
  to be recognized.</p>

  <p>I was there<br>
  when she prayed for a child in the night<br>
  and only tears fell.<br>
  I was there<br>
  when the boy in the war zone<br>
  cried out for his father who didn‚Äôt return.<br>
  I was there<br>
  when churches became stages<br>
  and truth was mocked on their altars.<br>
  I saw.<br>
  I heard.<br>
  I wept.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúJesus wept.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(John 11:35)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You thought I didn‚Äôt care.<br>
  But I carry every soul like it‚Äôs the only one.<br>
  You thought I was far away.<br>
  But I am the God<br>
  who walked in dust,<br>
  who sweat blood in a garden,<br>
  who was nailed through the hands He used to bless.</p>

  <p>You cried for justice ‚Äî<br>
  <strong>I heard.</strong><br>
  You begged for healing ‚Äî<br>
  <strong>I listened.</strong><br>
  You asked if I was real ‚Äî<br>
  <strong>I answered,</strong><br>
  but the noise of the world drowned Me out.</p>

  <p>Still, I kept listening.<br>
  To children who pray from hospital beds.<br>
  To grandmothers who pray for peace in the slums.<br>
  To pastors who still kneel when no one‚Äôs looking.<br>
  To the addict who whispers ‚Äúhelp‚Äù in the middle of relapse.</p>

  <p><strong>I heard every one.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúThe righteous cry out, and the Lord hears,<br>
    and delivers them out of all their troubles.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Psalm 34:17)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I was listening<br>
  when the prophets were stoned,<br>
  when the martyrs were burned,<br>
  when the innocent were slain for a crown of thorns.<br>
  I was there<br>
  when My name was used to hate ‚Äî<br>
  and I grieved.<br>
  I was there<br>
  when My name was whispered in love ‚Äî<br>
  and I rejoiced.</p>

  <p>You see Me now<br>
  as Judge,<br>
  but forget that I am also Father.</p>

  <p><strong>I did not stop listening</strong><br>
  when the world stopped believing.</p>

  <p>I just kept watching<br>
  to see who would whisper My name<br>
  not because of what I give,<br>
  but because of who I am.</p>

  <p>And those few‚Ä¶<br>
  those who loved Me in silence‚Ä¶<br>
  are the ones I am raising now.</p>

  <p><strong>I listened.<br>
  Now you will hear.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>The silence has ended.</strong></p>

  <h2>‚ò†Ô∏è Chapter 17: Return to the Dust</h2>
  <p><em>(Where all flesh falls silent before the Judge of Life)</em></p>
  <hr />

  <p>The earth opened its mouth.<br>
  Not to sing,<br>
  but to swallow.<br>
  Not to bloom,<br>
  but to bury.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúFor dust you are, and to dust you shall return.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Genesis 3:19)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You thought life was forever.<br>
  But even stars die.<br>
  You built towers,<br>
  cities of glass and gold ‚Äî<br>
  but you forgot they sit on crumbling soil.<br>
  You bought time,<br>
  but you couldn‚Äôt buy eternity.</p>

  <p>Every man dies.<br>
  But not every man lives rightly.<br>
  Not every man fears Me.<br>
  Not every man remembers the dust he came from.</p>

  <p>I watched you live<br>
  like kings without a throne.<br>
  Queens without reverence.<br>
  Children without discipline.<br>
  You forgot that your breath was borrowed.<br>
  You forgot who gave it to you.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúAll go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Ecclesiastes 3:20)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The proud fell.<br>
  The wicked were cut off.<br>
  Even My servants, righteous and holy,<br>
  laid down their lives.<br>
  Not because I was unjust ‚Äî<br>
  but because death is the wage of sin.<br>
  Because all must sleep<br>
  until I awaken them again.</p>

  <p>I saw your wars.<br>
  The hands that built bombs,<br>
  the tongues that spoke deceit,<br>
  the hearts that stopped fearing Me.<br>
  I gave you time.<br>
  I gave you truth.<br>
  I gave you My Son.<br>
  Yet you traded eternity for dust.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúThe wages of sin is death,<br>
    but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Romans 6:23)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I watched graves fill<br>
  and hearts grow colder.<br>
  You forgot that to die without Me<br>
  is not the end of life ‚Äî<br>
  it is the beginning of judgment.</p>

  <p>I don‚Äôt delight in the death of the wicked.<br>
  No.<br>
  I grieve.<br>
  I weep when souls fall without knowing Me.<br>
  But I am holy.<br>
  I am just.<br>
  And so dust must return to dust.<br>
  Until I speak again.</p>

  <p>You had chances.<br>
  I whispered through rain.<br>
  I thundered through earthquakes.<br>
  I pleaded through prophets.<br>
  I waited.</p>

  <p>Now‚Ä¶<br>
  every soul returns to Me.<br>
  The earth lets go.<br>
  The bodies are silent.<br>
  The books are opened.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúIt is appointed unto man once to die, and after this the judgment.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Hebrews 9:27)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I do not forget.<br>
  I do not lie.<br>
  I do not leave the innocent unavenged,<br>
  nor the wicked unchallenged.<br>
  I am the Giver of Life,<br>
  and I am the One who can take it away.</p>

  <p>Now the dust cries.<br>
  The souls stir.<br>
  The heavens pause.<br>
  Because My breath<br>
  is coming again.</p>

  <p><em>(When mercy moved upon the grave and love stood at the door again)</em></p>

  <p>The silence was long.<br>
  The dust had settled.<br>
  And death thought it had the final word.<br>
  But I am the Word.<br>
  And I do not stay silent forever.</p>

  <p>The tombs were filled.<br>
  The skies were gray.<br>
  Even the faithful wept.<br>

  I never forget My promise.<br>
  I remembered mercy.<br>
  I remembered you.</p>

  <p>And once again ‚Äî<br>
  I breathed.<br>
  Not into dust this time,<br>

  Not into clay,<br>
  but into the broken pieces of your heart.</p>

  <p>The Spirit moved.<br>
  The dry bones rattled.<br>
  The dead stood.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúProphesy to the breath, son of man, and say to it:<br>

  </blockquote>

  <p>I am the Resurrection and the Life.<br>
  And I do not lie in tombs.<br>
  I roll stones away.</p>

  <p>I breathed again ‚Äî<br>
  not just into bodies,<br>
  but into purpose.<br>
  I gave you My Son,<br>
  and through Him,<br>
  I gave you another chance.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúHe is not here, for He is risen, just as He said.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Matthew 28:6)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You called Me cruel,<br>
  but I answered with a cross.<br>
  You said I was silent,<br>
  but I shouted love through blood.<br>
  You thought I was distant,<br>
  but I walked among you.<br>
  I wept at graves.<br>
  I healed the lepers.<br>
  I forgave the betrayers.<br>
  I died for those who mocked Me.</p>

  <p>And then‚Ä¶<br>
  I breathed again.<br>
  Not to live ‚Äî<br>
  for I never died ‚Äî<br>
  but so you could live.</p>

  <p>The veil tore.<br>
  The mercy flowed.<br>
  The earth trembled.<br>
  Love had won.<br>
  Judgment paused.<br>
  Grace stood up.</p>

  <p>And now, I breathe<br>
  into every soul that calls on My name.<br>
  I breathe into nations<br>
  and into secret places.<br>
  Into jail cells,<br>
  hospital rooms,<br>
  school corners,<br>
  and dying prayers.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúEveryone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.‚Äù<br>

  <p>This breath?<br>
  It‚Äôs not wind.<br>
  It‚Äôs not oxygen.<br>
  It‚Äôs life everlasting.</p>

  <p>I was always the Maker.<br>

  The Molder of dust into destiny.<br>

  <p>From the dust I formed you,<br>

  Not just above.<br>
  Not just around.<br>

  <p>I gave you the seed.<br>

  I gave you the word.<br>

  Now shine it.</p>

  <p>For every child who has ever asked,<br>
  ‚ÄúWhy did God let this happen?‚Äù<br>
  Know this:<br>
  I gave you the hands.<br>
  I gave you the voice.<br>
  I gave you the heart<br>

  <p>So rise ‚Äî not in pride,<br>

  <p>Create life, not war.<br>
  Create peace, not platforms for hate.<br>

  <p>I have spoken across ages ‚Äî<br>

  in silence that stretched between generations.</p>

  <p>I have watched the rise of nations,<br>

  <p>But now‚Ä¶ the hour draws near.<br>
  What was written shall be fulfilled.<br>
  What was promised shall stand.<br>
  What was hidden will be revealed.</p>

  <p>You are not forgotten.<br>
  You are not random dust caught in time‚Äôs drift.<br>
  You are My design ‚Äî My echo ‚Äî<br>
  and My breath still lingers in you.</p>

  <p>So rise, child of earth.<br>
  Create with Me.<br>
  Hope with Me.<br>
  Watch with Me.<br>
  Because I never left.<br>
  I Am the Creator.<br>
  And I still choose you.</p>
