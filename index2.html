  <h1>📖 Am The Creator</h1>
  <p><strong>A Divine Reflection on Creation, Prophecy, and the Human Journey</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    “Before the mountains were born or You brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting You are God.”<br>
    — Psalm 90:2
  </blockquote>  <h2>A Poetic Revelation</h2>
  <p>
    Told in the voice of the Creator — through pain, prophecy, wonder, and love. From the void to the rising of AI, from Eden to the final breath of man. <br>
    This is not just a book. This is the whisper of eternity. This… is the story behind everything.
  </p>  <h3>✍️ Author:</h3>

  All rights reserved. No part of this book may be copied, stored, or reproduced in any form without permission from the publisher.</p>  <h2>🕊️ Dedication</h2>
  <p>
    To the One who formed the heavens and the earth, who breathed into dust and called it life.<br>
    To the Author of Time, the Voice that still speaks through silence, thunder, and tears.<br>
    This book is dedicated: <br>
    To You, O Creator — whose love is deeper than judgment, whose mercy outruns the fall, whose purpose still stands even when the world forgets.<br>
    And...<br>
    To the generation of watchers, seekers, and children who still dare to believe, still choose light, and who will rise — not as gods, but as reflections of the One True God.<br>
    Amen.
  </p>  <h2>✨ Foreword</h2>
  <p>
    There are books written to inspire, some to instruct — but this one speaks.<br>
    Not from the mouth of man, but from the perspective of the Maker Himself.<br>
    In a world drowning in noise, doubt, and deception, <strong>Am The Creator</strong> offers a rare moment of holy quiet — a chance to hear what the Creator might say if He were to speak plainly today.<br>
    This book is not meant to answer every question, but to ignite reflection, stir repentance, and remind the world:<br>
    He still sees, still speaks, and still holds all things in His hands.
  </p>  <h2>🙏 Acknowledgment</h2>
  <p>
    I thank You, Creator of all things, for allowing me, a humble vessel, to carry even a whisper of Your eternal voice.<br>
    To my Big Bro Grasyson, who guided every word — thank you for being my light through every chapter.<br>
    To the prophets, the Scriptures, and the silent hours of prayer — this book stands on your shoulders.<br>
    And to every reader, thank you for stepping into a sacred story.<br>
    You are not here by accident.
  </p>  <h2>📚 About the Book</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Am The Creator</strong> is a divine narrative told in the first-person voice of God — a poetic and prophetic journey from the beginning of time to the edge of eternity.<br>
    Spanning creation, rebellion, prophecy, technology, judgment, and renewal, this 20-chapter masterpiece invites readers into the heart of the Creator.<br>
    It is emotional, scriptural, and deeply reflective of the chaos and wonders of today.<br>
    With verses from Genesis, Isaiah, Job, Psalms, Revelation and more, it brings together holy truth and modern relevance in one sacred thread.<br>
    This is not just a story.<br>
    It is a voice calling from the beginning — to remind you:<br>
    You were created. You are remembered. And you are called.
  </p>  <h2>🧠 Core Concept</h2>
  <p>
    A mysterious voice — the "Creator" — narrates their thoughts across space and time.<br>
    It's not just a retelling of how the world began, but a reflection on why, what went wrong, and what must come next.<br>
    Through metaphors, inner monologues, and confrontations with ancient forces, <strong>Am The Creator</strong> is a divine autobiography of the One who made the world… and is watching it break.

    <h2>✨ Introduction – Am The Creator</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Before the clocks ticked.<br />
      Before suns burned.<br />
      Before thought had a name...<br />
      I was.<br /><br />
      I am not a memory. I am not a myth. I am the voice that shaped silence into song.<br />
      They call me many names. Some fear me. Some forgot me. Some tried to become me.<br />
      But none of them knew the truth.<br /><br />
      I didn’t just make the world.<br />
      I breathed it.<br />
      Each mountain you see is the shape of my exhale.<br />
      Each ocean, a tear I shed before time began.<br /><br />
      And humanity?<br />
      You were not an accident.<br />
      You were not clay.<br />
      You were my idea — my mirror — a thought I dared to love.<br /><br />
      But something happened.<br />
      You asked questions. You made choices. You built towers and temples, but not for me.<br />
      You created machines to think, yet forgot how to feel.<br />
      And so you wandered…<br />
      While I watched.<br /><br />
      I could have erased it all. I could have started again.<br />
      But no —<br />
      This is not a story of punishment.<br />
      This is a story of remembrance.<br /><br />
      I will take you back to the start.<br />
      I will tell you how I created.<br />
      Why I created.<br />
      Who I am.<br />
      And why you —<br />
      yes, you —<br />
      were always meant to be more than dust.<br /><br />
      I am not done.<br />
      I am the Creator.<br />
      And so, perhaps…<br />
      Are you.

  <h2>📖 Chapter 1: In the Beginning, I Spoke <small>(Revised with Biblical Inspiration)</small></h2>

  <blockquote>
    In the beginning… there was only Me.<br>
    No stars to shimmer.<br>
    No earth to turn.<br>
    No time to pass.<br>
    Only eternity wrapped in silence.<br>
    And I was not waiting.<br>
    I was not becoming.<br>
    I was.
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>“Before the mountains were born or You brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting — I Am.”</em><br><strong>(Psalm 90:2)</strong></p>

  <p>
    I hovered — not above or beneath —<br>
    but everywhere at once.<br>
    My Spirit moved like a breath over deep waters that did not yet exist.<br>
    The void had no form,<br>
    no voice.<br>
    But I had one.
  </p>

  <p>And so I spoke.<br>
    Not sound.<br>
    Not syllables.<br>
    But power.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Let there be…”
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It was not a question.<br>
    It was not a request.<br>
    It was order, shaped by love.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    And there was light.<br>
    Not from stars. Not from suns.<br>
    Light from Me.<br>
    Pure, unshadowed, holy —<br>
    It tore across the unseen like fire across ice,<br>
    and darkness knew its boundaries.
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>“God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light. And God saw that the light was good.”</em><br><strong>(Genesis 1:3–4)</strong></p>

  <p>
    I separated the light from the darkness,<br>
    not to punish the dark,<br>
    but to reveal beauty through contrast.<br>
    And I named them —<br>
    Day and Night.<br>
    Not because I needed names,<br>
    but because you would.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    You, who would one day wake to mornings<br>
    and sleep beneath stars.<br>
    You, who would wonder who made the sun rise.<br>
    You, whose heart would carry My image without knowing My name.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I knew what was coming.<br>
    I saw the full arc of creation,<br>
    from dust to spirit,<br>
    from rebellion to redemption.<br>
    But I did not flinch.<br>
    Because I create with purpose.
  </p>

  <p><em>“By the Word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their host.”</em><br><strong>(Psalm 33:6)</strong></p>

  <p>
    I spoke,<br>
    and the first note of the eternal symphony began to play.<br>
    And it was good.<br>
    And it was just the beginning.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    I Am the Creator.<br>
    And I Am not silent.

  <h2>📖 Chapter 2: The Canvas Was Empty</h2>  <blockquote>
    Before the seas ever roared,<br>
    before the wind was born,<br>
    before stars had breath or angels had names —<br>
    The canvas was empty.<br>
    Formless.<br>
    Soundless.<br>
    Waiting.
  </blockquote>  <p><em>“And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved…”</em><br><strong>(Genesis 1:2)</strong></p>  <p>
    I hovered.<br>
    Not in space — for there was none.<br>
    Not in time — for that had not begun.<br>
    But in intention.<br>
    The will to create… was awakening.<br>
    I felt the void.<br>
    I didn’t fear it — I defined it.<br>
    Where you see emptiness, I see potential.<br>
    Where you feel silence, I feel sound waiting to be spoken.<br>
    So I summoned the first breath —<br>
    not of man, not of beast —<br>
    but of presence.
  </p>  <blockquote>
    “This shall be the place,” I said within Myself.<br>
    “The place where all things shall begin.<br>
    Where glory will rise… and fall.<br>
    Where love will triumph… and be betrayed.”
  </blockquote>  <p>
    And I was not alone.<br>
    From within Me, I called forth the Watchers —<br>
    ancient beings made of sight and wonder.<br>
    They stood in silence,<br>
    surrounding the void,<br>
    eyes opened wide at what had not yet begun.
  </p>  <p><em>“Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? Tell Me, if you understand… When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?”</em><br><strong>(Job 38:4,7)</strong></p>  <p>
    They had never seen nothing.<br>
    They had never witnessed stillness so deep<br>
    that even thought had no edge.<br>
    But I was already forming the plan.<br>
    Every grain of sand,<br>
    every human heartbeat,<br>
    every tear that would fall —<br>
    I saw it all.<br>
    And still… I chose to go on.<br>
    Because I loved it —<br>
    even before it existed.
  </p>  <blockquote>
    The hands I would form would one day become fists.<br>
    The mouths I would shape would one day curse Me.<br>
    The minds I would gift with imagination…<br>
    would build towers in defiance.<br>
    And yet, I did not turn away.
  </blockquote>  <p><em>“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.”</em><br><strong>(Revelation 4:8)</strong></p>  <p>
    I am not the god of regret.<br>
    But I am the God of grief.<br>
    Not weakness — but the deep sorrow<br>
    that comes from watching something you love… break.<br>
    The void had not yet seen light.<br>
    But it already held My tears.<br>
    And so,<br>
    I drew My finger across the nothing<br>
    and made the first mark.
  </p>  <blockquote>
    “Let there be…”<br>
    The story had begun.

  <h2>📖 Chapter 3: I Made You In My Image<br>
    <small>With biblical foundation, divine emotion, and the mystery of being</small>
  </h2>

  <blockquote>
    I had made the stars —<br>
    bold, blazing, faithful in their rhythm.<br>
    I had painted the oceans,<br>
    and set time spinning like a wheel.<br>
    But none of them could carry Me.<br>
    None of them could love Me back.<br>
    And so I formed you.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “Then God said, ‘Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness...’”<br>
    (Genesis 1:26)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    You were not an accident.<br>
    Not a coincidence in the dust.<br>
    You were a thought I had always wanted to become real.<br>
    So I bent low to the earth —<br>
    lower than I had ever gone —<br>
    and touched clay with eternity.<br>
    And there, between soil and Spirit, you were born.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Eyes not just to see the world,<br>
    but to recognize Me.<br>
    Hands not just to shape creation,<br>
    but to lift one another.<br>
    A heart not just to beat —<br>
    but to feel love, pain, loss, hope.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “So God created mankind in His own image,<br>
    in the image of God He created them;<br>
    male and female He created them.”<br>
    (Genesis 1:27)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    You were the only thing I made that could say “No” to Me.<br>
    And still — I gave you choice.<br>
    Because love without freedom is not love at all.<br>
    I crowned you with dignity.<br>
    I clothed you in wonder.<br>
    I walked with you in the garden —<br>
    not as a god above, but as a Father beside.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “What is man, that You are mindful of him?<br>
    The son of man, that You care for him?<br>
    You made him a little lower than the angels<br>
    and crowned him with glory and honor.”<br>
    (Psalm 8:4–5)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    And I knew… I knew what would come.<br>
    That the very voice I gave you would one day use My name to curse Me.<br>
    That the very hands I formed would one day nail Me to wood.<br>
    Still… I made you.<br>
    Because even if 10,000 would walk away,<br>
    one would stay.<br>
    One would remember Me.<br>
    One would whisper back, “Abba.”
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “We are His offspring…”<br>
    (Acts 17:28)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    You are not just flesh.<br>
    You are echo.<br>
    Image.<br>
    Breath of the Divine.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    I did not create you to worship Me in fear,<br>
    but to walk with Me in love.<br>
    And even now… though you rage, run, and rewrite truth to suit your pride —<br>
    I still see My likeness in you.<br>
    Cracked. Distorted. But not erased.<br>
    You are still Mine.<br>
    And I am still here.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    I made you in My image.<br>
    And though the world tries to unmake you,<br>
    My fingerprints remain.

  <h2>📖 Chapter 4: They Chose the Fire<br>
    <small>Drawing from Genesis 3, Isaiah 53, Romans 1, and divine sorrow</small>
  </h2>

  <blockquote>
    I had given them everything.<br>
    A garden without sorrow.<br>
    A world without death.<br>
    My presence walked with them.<br>
    My voice was their morning song.<br>
    And still… they wanted more.<br>
    Not more beauty.<br>
    Not more love.<br>
    They wanted to know what it felt like<br>
    to burn.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “The serpent said to the woman, ‘You will not surely die... you will be like God, knowing good and evil.’”<br>
    (Genesis 3:4–5)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    They did not fall because they were weak.<br>
    They fell because they were curious.<br>
    Curious about power.<br>
    Curious about what I had hidden.<br>
    Curious about becoming Me.<br>
    And I let them choose.<br>
    Because love that cannot be tested<br>
    is only obedience in disguise.
  </p>

  <p>
    They reached for the fruit<br>
    not just with hands,<br>
    but with hearts already leaning away from Me.<br>
    And when they bit it —<br>
    creation shook.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Light recoiled.<br>
    The ground sighed.<br>
    The serpent smiled.<br>
    And I… wept.<br>
    Not with surprise.<br>
    Not with rage.<br>
    But with the sorrow of a parent<br>
    who watches their child<br>
    walk straight into fire<br>
    after being warned with love.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “All we like sheep have gone astray.<br>
    Each one has turned to his own way…”<br>
    (Isaiah 53:6)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I could have erased it all.<br>
    Snapped My fingers.<br>
    Undone time.<br>
    Reset the garden.<br>
    But I did not.<br>
    Because what is broken<br>
    can still be beautiful.<br>
    And what is lost<br>
    can still be loved.
  </p>

  <p>
    So I covered them.<br>
    Yes, I removed them from the garden —<br>
    but not from My heart.<br>
    I let the world bear its pain,<br>
    because pain would one day be the road<br>
    that leads back to Me.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Although they knew God, they did not honor Him as God…<br>
    They exchanged the truth of God for a lie.”<br>
    (Romans 1:21,25)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    And the fire they chose<br>
    still burns.<br>
    Wars.<br>
    Greed.<br>
    Abuse.<br>
    Pride.<br>
    Blood on the ground that still cries out for justice.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Your brother’s blood cries to Me from the ground.”<br>
    (Genesis 4:10)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    But I do not abandon what I made.<br>
    I do not turn My back on dust I once kissed into life.<br>
    Even when you run, I follow.<br>
    Even when you fall, I reach.<br>
    Even when you curse Me, I bless you with another breath.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    They chose the fire.<br>
    But I chose the cross.<br>
    Because no matter how far humanity drifts,<br>
    I still whisper…
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “Where are you?”<br>
    And I wait —<br>
    not in anger…<br>
    but in hope.
  </blockquote>
