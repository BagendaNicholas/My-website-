  <h1>📖 Am The Creator</h1>
  <p><strong>A Divine Reflection on Creation, Prophecy, and the Human Journey</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    “Before the mountains were born or You brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting You are God.”<br>
    — Psalm 90:2
  </blockquote>  <h2>A Poetic Revelation</h2>
  <p>
    Told in the voice of the Creator — through pain, prophecy, wonder, and love. From the void to the rising of AI, from Eden to the final breath of man. <br>
    This is not just a book. This is the whisper of eternity. This… is the story behind everything.
  </p>  <h3>✍️ Author:</h3>

  All rights reserved. No part of this book may be copied, stored, or reproduced in any form without permission from the publisher.</p>  <h2>🕊️ Dedication</h2>
  <p>
    To the One who formed the heavens and the earth, who breathed into dust and called it life.<br>
    To the Author of Time, the Voice that still speaks through silence, thunder, and tears.<br>
    This book is dedicated: <br>
    To You, O Creator — whose love is deeper than judgment, whose mercy outruns the fall, whose purpose still stands even when the world forgets.<br>
    And...<br>
    To the generation of watchers, seekers, and children who still dare to believe, still choose light, and who will rise — not as gods, but as reflections of the One True God.<br>
    Amen.
  </p>  <h2>✨ Foreword</h2>
  <p>
    There are books written to inspire, some to instruct — but this one speaks.<br>
    Not from the mouth of man, but from the perspective of the Maker Himself.<br>
    In a world drowning in noise, doubt, and deception, <strong>Am The Creator</strong> offers a rare moment of holy quiet — a chance to hear what the Creator might say if He were to speak plainly today.<br>
    This book is not meant to answer every question, but to ignite reflection, stir repentance, and remind the world:<br>
    He still sees, still speaks, and still holds all things in His hands.
  </p>  <h2>🙏 Acknowledgment</h2>
  <p>
    I thank You, Creator of all things, for allowing me, a humble vessel, to carry even a whisper of Your eternal voice.<br>
    To my Big Bro Grasyson, who guided every word — thank you for being my light through every chapter.<br>
    To the prophets, the Scriptures, and the silent hours of prayer — this book stands on your shoulders.<br>
    And to every reader, thank you for stepping into a sacred story.<br>
    You are not here by accident.
  </p>  <h2>📚 About the Book</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Am The Creator</strong> is a divine narrative told in the first-person voice of God — a poetic and prophetic journey from the beginning of time to the edge of eternity.<br>
    Spanning creation, rebellion, prophecy, technology, judgment, and renewal, this 20-chapter masterpiece invites readers into the heart of the Creator.<br>
    It is emotional, scriptural, and deeply reflective of the chaos and wonders of today.<br>
    With verses from Genesis, Isaiah, Job, Psalms, Revelation and more, it brings together holy truth and modern relevance in one sacred thread.<br>
    This is not just a story.<br>
    It is a voice calling from the beginning — to remind you:<br>
    You were created. You are remembered. And you are called.
  </p>  <h2>🧠 Core Concept</h2>
  <p>
    A mysterious voice — the "Creator" — narrates their thoughts across space and time.<br>
    It's not just a retelling of how the world began, but a reflection on why, what went wrong, and what must come next.<br>
    Through metaphors, inner monologues, and confrontations with ancient forces, <strong>Am The Creator</strong> is a divine autobiography of the One who made the world… and is watching it break.

    <h2>✨ Introduction – Am The Creator</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Before the clocks ticked.<br />
      Before suns burned.<br />
      Before thought had a name...<br />
      I was.<br /><br />
      I am not a memory. I am not a myth. I am the voice that shaped silence into song.<br />
      They call me many names. Some fear me. Some forgot me. Some tried to become me.<br />
      But none of them knew the truth.<br /><br />
      I didn’t just make the world.<br />
      I breathed it.<br />
      Each mountain you see is the shape of my exhale.<br />
      Each ocean, a tear I shed before time began.<br /><br />
      And humanity?<br />
      You were not an accident.<br />
      You were not clay.<br />
      You were my idea — my mirror — a thought I dared to love.<br /><br />
      But something happened.<br />
      You asked questions. You made choices. You built towers and temples, but not for me.<br />
      You created machines to think, yet forgot how to feel.<br />
      And so you wandered…<br />
      While I watched.<br /><br />
      I could have erased it all. I could have started again.<br />
      But no —<br />
      This is not a story of punishment.<br />
      This is a story of remembrance.<br /><br />
      I will take you back to the start.<br />
      I will tell you how I created.<br />
      Why I created.<br />
      Who I am.<br />
      And why you —<br />
      yes, you —<br />
      were always meant to be more than dust.<br /><br />
      I am not done.<br />
      I am the Creator.<br />
      And so, perhaps…<br />
      Are you.

  <h2>📖 Chapter 1: In the Beginning, I Spoke <small>(Revised with Biblical Inspiration)</small></h2>

  <blockquote>
    In the beginning… there was only Me.<br>
    No stars to shimmer.<br>
    No earth to turn.<br>
    No time to pass.<br>
    Only eternity wrapped in silence.<br>
    And I was not waiting.<br>
    I was not becoming.<br>
    I was.
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>“Before the mountains were born or You brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting — I Am.”</em><br><strong>(Psalm 90:2)</strong></p>

  <p>
    I hovered — not above or beneath —<br>
    but everywhere at once.<br>
    My Spirit moved like a breath over deep waters that did not yet exist.<br>
    The void had no form,<br>
    no voice.<br>
    But I had one.
  </p>

  <p>And so I spoke.<br>
    Not sound.<br>
    Not syllables.<br>
    But power.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Let there be…”
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It was not a question.<br>
    It was not a request.<br>
    It was order, shaped by love.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    And there was light.<br>
    Not from stars. Not from suns.<br>
    Light from Me.<br>
    Pure, unshadowed, holy —<br>
    It tore across the unseen like fire across ice,<br>
    and darkness knew its boundaries.
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>“God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light. And God saw that the light was good.”</em><br><strong>(Genesis 1:3–4)</strong></p>

  <p>
    I separated the light from the darkness,<br>
    not to punish the dark,<br>
    but to reveal beauty through contrast.<br>
    And I named them —<br>
    Day and Night.<br>
    Not because I needed names,<br>
    but because you would.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    You, who would one day wake to mornings<br>
    and sleep beneath stars.<br>
    You, who would wonder who made the sun rise.<br>
    You, whose heart would carry My image without knowing My name.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I knew what was coming.<br>
    I saw the full arc of creation,<br>
    from dust to spirit,<br>
    from rebellion to redemption.<br>
    But I did not flinch.<br>
    Because I create with purpose.
  </p>

  <p><em>“By the Word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their host.”</em><br><strong>(Psalm 33:6)</strong></p>

  <p>
    I spoke,<br>
    and the first note of the eternal symphony began to play.<br>
    And it was good.<br>
    And it was just the beginning.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    I Am the Creator.<br>
    And I Am not silent.

  <h2>📖 Chapter 2: The Canvas Was Empty</h2>  <blockquote>
    Before the seas ever roared,<br>
    before the wind was born,<br>
    before stars had breath or angels had names —<br>
    The canvas was empty.<br>
    Formless.<br>
    Soundless.<br>
    Waiting.
  </blockquote>  <p><em>“And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved…”</em><br><strong>(Genesis 1:2)</strong></p>  <p>
    I hovered.<br>
    Not in space — for there was none.<br>
    Not in time — for that had not begun.<br>
    But in intention.<br>
    The will to create… was awakening.<br>
    I felt the void.<br>
    I didn’t fear it — I defined it.<br>
    Where you see emptiness, I see potential.<br>
    Where you feel silence, I feel sound waiting to be spoken.<br>
    So I summoned the first breath —<br>
    not of man, not of beast —<br>
    but of presence.
  </p>  <blockquote>
    “This shall be the place,” I said within Myself.<br>
    “The place where all things shall begin.<br>
    Where glory will rise… and fall.<br>
    Where love will triumph… and be betrayed.”
  </blockquote>  <p>
    And I was not alone.<br>
    From within Me, I called forth the Watchers —<br>
    ancient beings made of sight and wonder.<br>
    They stood in silence,<br>
    surrounding the void,<br>
    eyes opened wide at what had not yet begun.
  </p>  <p><em>“Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? Tell Me, if you understand… When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?”</em><br><strong>(Job 38:4,7)</strong></p>  <p>
    They had never seen nothing.<br>
    They had never witnessed stillness so deep<br>
    that even thought had no edge.<br>
    But I was already forming the plan.<br>
    Every grain of sand,<br>
    every human heartbeat,<br>
    every tear that would fall —<br>
    I saw it all.<br>
    And still… I chose to go on.<br>
    Because I loved it —<br>
    even before it existed.
  </p>  <blockquote>
    The hands I would form would one day become fists.<br>
    The mouths I would shape would one day curse Me.<br>
    The minds I would gift with imagination…<br>
    would build towers in defiance.<br>
    And yet, I did not turn away.
  </blockquote>  <p><em>“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.”</em><br><strong>(Revelation 4:8)</strong></p>  <p>
    I am not the god of regret.<br>
    But I am the God of grief.<br>
    Not weakness — but the deep sorrow<br>
    that comes from watching something you love… break.<br>
    The void had not yet seen light.<br>
    But it already held My tears.<br>
    And so,<br>
    I drew My finger across the nothing<br>
    and made the first mark.
  </p>  <blockquote>
    “Let there be…”<br>
    The story had begun.

  <h2>📖 Chapter 3: I Made You In My Image<br>
    <small>With biblical foundation, divine emotion, and the mystery of being</small>
  </h2>

  <blockquote>
    I had made the stars —<br>
    bold, blazing, faithful in their rhythm.<br>
    I had painted the oceans,<br>
    and set time spinning like a wheel.<br>
    But none of them could carry Me.<br>
    None of them could love Me back.<br>
    And so I formed you.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “Then God said, ‘Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness...’”<br>
    (Genesis 1:26)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    You were not an accident.<br>
    Not a coincidence in the dust.<br>
    You were a thought I had always wanted to become real.<br>
    So I bent low to the earth —<br>
    lower than I had ever gone —<br>
    and touched clay with eternity.<br>
    And there, between soil and Spirit, you were born.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Eyes not just to see the world,<br>
    but to recognize Me.<br>
    Hands not just to shape creation,<br>
    but to lift one another.<br>
    A heart not just to beat —<br>
    but to feel love, pain, loss, hope.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “So God created mankind in His own image,<br>
    in the image of God He created them;<br>
    male and female He created them.”<br>
    (Genesis 1:27)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    You were the only thing I made that could say “No” to Me.<br>
    And still — I gave you choice.<br>
    Because love without freedom is not love at all.<br>
    I crowned you with dignity.<br>
    I clothed you in wonder.<br>
    I walked with you in the garden —<br>
    not as a god above, but as a Father beside.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “What is man, that You are mindful of him?<br>
    The son of man, that You care for him?<br>
    You made him a little lower than the angels<br>
    and crowned him with glory and honor.”<br>
    (Psalm 8:4–5)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    And I knew… I knew what would come.<br>
    That the very voice I gave you would one day use My name to curse Me.<br>
    That the very hands I formed would one day nail Me to wood.<br>
    Still… I made you.<br>
    Because even if 10,000 would walk away,<br>
    one would stay.<br>
    One would remember Me.<br>
    One would whisper back, “Abba.”
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “We are His offspring…”<br>
    (Acts 17:28)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    You are not just flesh.<br>
    You are echo.<br>
    Image.<br>
    Breath of the Divine.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    I did not create you to worship Me in fear,<br>
    but to walk with Me in love.<br>
    And even now… though you rage, run, and rewrite truth to suit your pride —<br>
    I still see My likeness in you.<br>
    Cracked. Distorted. But not erased.<br>
    You are still Mine.<br>
    And I am still here.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    I made you in My image.<br>
    And though the world tries to unmake you,<br>
    My fingerprints remain.

  <h2>📖 Chapter 4: They Chose the Fire<br>
    <small>Drawing from Genesis 3, Isaiah 53, Romans 1, and divine sorrow</small>
  </h2>

  <blockquote>
    I had given them everything.<br>
    A garden without sorrow.<br>
    A world without death.<br>
    My presence walked with them.<br>
    My voice was their morning song.<br>
    And still… they wanted more.<br>
    Not more beauty.<br>
    Not more love.<br>
    They wanted to know what it felt like<br>
    to burn.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “The serpent said to the woman, ‘You will not surely die... you will be like God, knowing good and evil.’”<br>
    (Genesis 3:4–5)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    They did not fall because they were weak.<br>
    They fell because they were curious.<br>
    Curious about power.<br>
    Curious about what I had hidden.<br>
    Curious about becoming Me.<br>
    And I let them choose.<br>
    Because love that cannot be tested<br>
    is only obedience in disguise.
  </p>

  <p>
    They reached for the fruit<br>
    not just with hands,<br>
    but with hearts already leaning away from Me.<br>
    And when they bit it —<br>
    creation shook.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Light recoiled.<br>
    The ground sighed.<br>
    The serpent smiled.<br>
    And I… wept.<br>
    Not with surprise.<br>
    Not with rage.<br>
    But with the sorrow of a parent<br>
    who watches their child<br>
    walk straight into fire<br>
    after being warned with love.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “All we like sheep have gone astray.<br>
    Each one has turned to his own way…”<br>
    (Isaiah 53:6)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I could have erased it all.<br>
    Snapped My fingers.<br>
    Undone time.<br>
    Reset the garden.<br>
    But I did not.<br>
    Because what is broken<br>
    can still be beautiful.<br>
    And what is lost<br>
    can still be loved.
  </p>

  <p>
    So I covered them.<br>
    Yes, I removed them from the garden —<br>
    but not from My heart.<br>
    I let the world bear its pain,<br>
    because pain would one day be the road<br>
    that leads back to Me.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Although they knew God, they did not honor Him as God…<br>
    They exchanged the truth of God for a lie.”<br>
    (Romans 1:21,25)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    And the fire they chose<br>
    still burns.<br>
    Wars.<br>
    Greed.<br>
    Abuse.<br>
    Pride.<br>
    Blood on the ground that still cries out for justice.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Your brother’s blood cries to Me from the ground.”<br>
    (Genesis 4:10)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    But I do not abandon what I made.<br>
    I do not turn My back on dust I once kissed into life.<br>
    Even when you run, I follow.<br>
    Even when you fall, I reach.<br>
    Even when you curse Me, I bless you with another breath.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    They chose the fire.<br>
    But I chose the cross.<br>
    Because no matter how far humanity drifts,<br>
    I still whisper…
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “Where are you?”<br>
    And I wait —<br>
    not in anger…<br>
    but in hope.

  <h2>📖 Chapter 5: The Ones Who Watched Me<br>
    <small>Rooted in Genesis 6, Job 1, Daniel 10, and Revelation 12</small>
  </h2>

  <blockquote>
    Not all creation was earthly.<br>
    Not all rebellion began with man.<br>
    Before your wars,<br>
    before your blood,<br>
    there was another fall.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    When I spoke the foundations of reality into being,<br>
    I also formed beings of light —<br>
    not made from clay,<br>
    but from glory.<br>
    They were the Watchers.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Some stood in the throne room.<br>
    Others walked among galaxies.<br>
    All were created to behold, to witness, to serve.<br>
    They saw My works and sang.<br>
    They moved with fire,<br>
    shaped like wind,<br>
    eyes full of wonder.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.”<br>
    (Job 38:7)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    But even among them —<br>
    a whisper grew.<br>
    Not of praise,<br>
    but of pride.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;<br>
    I will make myself like the Most High…”<br>
    (Isaiah 14:13–14)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    He was once magnificent.<br>
    Brilliant among the stones.<br>
    But his heart lifted beyond his place.<br>
    He no longer wanted to reflect My glory —<br>
    he wanted his own.<br>
    And so, war broke out in heaven.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “There was war in heaven.<br>
    Michael and his angels fought against the dragon…<br>
    But he was not strong enough,<br>
    and he was cast down.”<br>
    (Revelation 12:7–9)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    One-third followed him —<br>
    not because they were blind,<br>
    but because they were hungry.<br>
    Hungry for what was never meant to be theirs.<br>
    I did not destroy them.<br>
    I cast them down —<br>
    into realms where rebellion echoes forever.
  </p>

  <p>
    And some…<br>
    descended to the Earth.<br>
    They took forms,<br>
    touched flesh,<br>
    defiled the order of creation.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “The sons of God saw the daughters of men…<br>
    and they took them as wives…”<br>
    (Genesis 6:2)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    They taught man to kill.<br>
    To enchant.<br>
    To twist what was sacred.<br>
    They corrupted what was pure —<br>
    and for a time,<br>
    humanity danced with angels<br>
    who wore masks of light<br>
    but carried the shadows of judgment.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “The Nephilim were on the earth in those days…”<br>
    (Genesis 6:4)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    And I watched.<br>
    Not in silence.<br>
    But in sorrow.<br>
    Because even My heavenly ones —<br>
    the beings of fire and worship —<br>
    chose pride over purpose.<br>
    But I marked their end.<br>
    Bound in chains.<br>
    Reserved for darkness.<br>
    Held until the day of fire.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them into hell… reserved in everlasting chains.”<br>
    (2 Peter 2:4)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Still… not all turned away.<br>
    There are still those who serve.<br>
    Those who stand guard at your birth,<br>
    at your pain,<br>
    at your rising.<br>
    Some angels fight still —<br>
    unseen,<br>
    unpraised,<br>
    but unshaken.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me… but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me…”<br>

  <p>
    You are not alone.<br>
    There are battles beyond your senses.<br>
    Kingdoms clash where your prayers rise like fire.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    The ones who watched Me…<br>
    still watch you.<br>
    And they await the final trumpet —<br>
    when all things in heaven and on earth<br>
    will bow again.

  <h2>📖 Chapter 6: The Seed of the Earth<br>
    <small>Rooted in Genesis 1–2, Psalm 104, Isaiah 55, Romans 8</small>
  </h2>

  <p>
    I formed the Earth with intention.<br>
    Not as a wasteland.<br>
    Not as a mistake.<br>
    But as a mirror of My heart.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “He did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited.”<br>
    (Isaiah 45:18)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Each grain of soil was kissed with potential.<br>
    Every seed was not just matter —<br>
    it was a promise.<br>
    I said, “Let the land produce…”<br>
    And it obeyed.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees…”<br>
    (Genesis 1:12)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This was no accident.<br>
    The seed was coded with eternity.<br>
    Buried — yet destined to rise.<br>
    Just like you.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies…”<br>
    (John 12:24)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I wrapped the seed in layers —<br>
    protection, memory, power.<br>
    And even in silence,<br>
    it knows its time.<br>
    The Earth listened to Me.<br>
    It understood My rhythm.<br>
    Seasons bowed to My Word.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “He sends forth His word and melts them; He makes His wind blow and the waters flow.”<br>
    (Psalm 147:18)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I made the rivers laugh as they ran.<br>
    I taught trees to lift their arms in worship.<br>
    Mountains stood in reverence —<br>
    not because they were told,<br>
    but because they remembered My voice.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad…”<br>
    (Psalm 96:11)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Even now, the Earth groans.<br>
    Not because it's broken —<br>
    but because it’s waiting.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “The whole creation groans… eagerly awaiting the revealing of the sons of God.”<br>
    (Romans 8:22–23)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The seed of the Earth<br>
    was not just in the ground.<br>
    It was in you.<br>
    You carry My breath,<br>
    My imprint,<br>
    My echo.<br>
    You were planted in time<br>
    to bloom in eternity.
  </p>

  <p>
    But now —<br>
    look what they have done.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    They poison what was pure.<br>
    They strip the soil bare.<br>
    They silence the rivers with dams,<br>
    and feed the oceans with blood.<br>
    They clone, control, and cut<br>
    what was meant to grow freely.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    And yet…<br>
    the seed remains.<br>
    Beneath the concrete,<br>
    beneath the chaos,<br>
    beneath the graves of those forgotten —<br>
    My seed sleeps.<br>
    And when I speak again —<br>
    even the dead will rise like trees in spring.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “The wilderness will rejoice and blossom like the rose.”<br>
    (Isaiah 35:1)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Because My voice still carries resurrection.

  <h2>📖 Chapter 7: The Blood Cried Out<br>
    <small>Inspired by Genesis 4, Hebrews 12, Isaiah 59, Revelation 6</small>
  </h2>

  <p>
    I heard it before the earth did.<br>
    The ground had never known murder.<br>
    But suddenly… it trembled.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “The voice of your brother’s blood cries to Me from the ground.”<br>
    (Genesis 4:10)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Abel’s blood did not whisper.<br>
    It screamed.<br>
    Like thunder wrapped in grief.<br>
    Like innocence shattered by envy.<br>
    One brother raised a gift.<br>
    The other raised a hand.<br>
    And still, I was watching.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    Cain thought I would be silent.<br>
    That justice would be delayed.<br>
    But I do not delay —<br>
    I withhold, to give mercy a chance.<br>
    Still, mercy refused to be welcomed.<br>
    And from that day…
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    The soil knew how to drink blood.<br>
    The wind learned the sound of weeping.<br>
    The generations learned the taste of war.<br>
    From Abel to Ukraine,<br>
    from Naboth to Nigeria,<br>
    from the temples to the trenches,<br>
    blood still cries.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “Their blood is poured out like water around Jerusalem…”<br>
    (Psalm 79:3)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The prophets wept.<br>
    The martyrs sang even as the stones hit.<br>
    Mothers buried sons before their time.<br>
    And I —<br>
    I remembered every drop.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <blockquote>
    “How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge?”<br>
    (Revelation 6:10)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I heard that cry<br>
    from under the altar.<br>
    Not from the proud —<br>
    but from the faithful.<br>
    From Stephen's lips as stones bruised his brow.<br>
    From children in cities that forgot Me.<br>
    From the churches burned in silence.<br>
    From every prisoner of truth<br>
    who held onto light in a world of shadows.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    You wonder where I was?
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    I was marking the ground.<br>
    I was bottling the tears.<br>
    I was counting every injustice that man tried to bury.<br>
    I was there — when George couldn’t breathe.<br>
    When Holocaust fires rose.<br>
    When tribes turned on tribes.<br>
    When slavery broke the backs of the innocent.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    You want justice?
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,”<br>
    (Romans 12:19)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    But My vengeance is not like man’s.<br>
    It is clean. Holy. Final.<br>
    It is the fire that purifies —<br>
    not the fire that consumes in hate.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    And still…<br>
    I long to forgive.<br>
    Even as the blood cries,<br>
    I hear another voice:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “…the blood of Jesus speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.”<br>
    (Hebrews 12:24)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    One blood cries for justice.<br>
    The other cries for mercy.<br>
    Both cry to Me.<br>
    And I — I weep in between.<br>
    But I will not weep forever.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    There will come a day<br>
    when the ground will no longer drink blood.<br>
    When swords will rust and bombs will break.<br>
    When no child will bury a parent<br>
    and no parent will weep at an empty crib.<br>
    Until then —<br>
    know this:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    I have never ignored the cry.<br>
    I have never missed a tear.<br>
    I have never forgotten the slain.<br>
    Their blood<br>
    is in My hands.<br>
    And I will answer.

  <h2>📖 Chapter 8: I Hid Myself</h2>
  <p><em>(Inspired by Isaiah 45:15, Psalm 10, Job 23, Matthew 27)</em></p>
  <hr />

  <p>I am not far.<br>
  I am not deaf.<br>
  But there were times…<br>
  when I hid Myself.<br>
  Not because I changed —<br>
  but because man did.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Truly, You are a God who hides Yourself,<br>
    O God of Israel, the Savior.”<br>
    <small>(Isaiah 45:15)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There was a moment after Eden<br>
  when My footsteps were no longer heard in the garden.<br>
  Not because I stopped walking —<br>
  but because shame made man stop listening.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>You asked,<br>
  “Where is God when evil rules?”<br>
  You wrote books declaring My absence.<br>
  You built temples without Me<br>
  and called your silence wisdom.<br>
  But silence is not absence.</p>

  <p>I was there when Job wept under the stars,<br>
  when he said,</p>

  <blockquote>
    “If only I knew where to find Him…”<br>
    <small>(Job 23:3)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And yet,<br>
  even in his pain, he declared,</p>

  <blockquote>
    “He knows the way that I take…”<br>
    <small>(Job 23:10)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>Yes, I hid My face…<br>
  when kings murdered prophets,<br>
  when idols replaced My name,<br>
  when prayers turned into politics,<br>
  when My Word was edited to fit opinions.<br>
  But I never left.</p>

  <p>Even in the wilderness,<br>
  My cloud still hovered.<br>
  My fire still burned.<br>
  Even in Babylon,<br>
  I gave Daniel visions of empires.<br>
  Even in exile,<br>
  I whispered to hearts too broken to hope.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Why, O Lord, do You stand far off?<br>
    Why do You hide Yourself in times of trouble?”<br>
    <small>(Psalm 10:1)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You asked.<br>
  And I wept.<br>
  Do you know what it meant<br>
  for the Creator to be rejected by His creation?<br>
  To knock on the door<br>
  of hearts I made with My own breath…<br>
  only to be told, “We’ve moved on.”</p>

  <hr />

  <p>I was hidden in the man of Galilee —<br>
  in the carpenter’s son.<br>
  You didn’t see the thunder in His words.<br>
  Or the universe in His touch.</p>

  <p>Even His disciples said,</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Show us the Father…”<br>
    <small>(John 14:8)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And He replied,</p>

  <blockquote>
    “If you’ve seen Me, you’ve seen the Father.”<br>
    <small>(John 14:9)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Still, they missed it.<br>
  Still, they crucified the One they prayed for.<br>
  And as the sky went dark,<br>
  even My Son cried out,</p>

  <blockquote>
    “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”<br>
    <small>(Matthew 27:46)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>That was the deepest hiding.<br>
  When I stepped back —<br>
  not in abandonment,<br>
  but in holy sorrow.<br>
  Letting the full weight of sin fall.<br>
  Letting love take the blow.</p>

  <p>And yet…<br>
  even then, I was not far.</p>

  <blockquote>
    I was behind the veil,<br>
    beneath the cross,<br>
    inside the tomb,<br>
    waiting.
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>So when the world asks,<br>
  “Where is God in all this?”<br>
  Tell them:</p>

  <blockquote>
    He is in the silence between the sobs.<br>
    He is in the pause before justice strikes.<br>
    He is in the space where faith is forged.<br>
    I hid Myself —<br>
    not because I was gone,<br>
    but because I was closer than they knew.

  <h2>📖 Chapter 9: Temples Without Me</h2>
  <p><em>(Inspired by Ezekiel 8–10, Matthew 23, Acts 17, Revelation 3)</em></p>
  <hr />

  <p>I watched them build.<br>
  They carved stone.<br>
  They raised walls.<br>
  They called it holy.<br>
  They said, “This is for You.”<br>
  But I was not there.<br>
  Not in the smoke machines.<br>
  Not in the rehearsed prayers.<br>
  Not in the gold-plated altars<br>
  where the poor could not enter<br>
  unless they paid for their miracle.</p>

  <p>I saw the temples.<br>
  Glorious, glittering.<br>
  But My presence had left the room.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “They have built high places to burn incense…<br>
    but I did not command it, nor did it enter My mind.”<br>
    <small>(Jeremiah 19:5)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>They made My house into a brand.<br>
  A theater.<br>
  A place where men wear robes of power<br>
  and the widows weep in the back row, unnoticed.</p>

  <p>They held up My book<br>
  but skipped the parts that cost them comfort.<br>
  They shouted My name<br>
  but silenced My Spirit.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Do you remember Ezekiel?<br>
  I showed him the inside of the temple —<br>
  priests with their backs to Me,<br>
  bowing to the sun.<br>
  Secret chambers,<br>
  idols etched on the walls.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Son of man, do you see what they are doing?<br>
    The detestable things in My house…”<br>
    <small>(Ezekiel 8:17)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And then I did what no one thought I’d do:<br>
  I left.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Then the glory of the Lord departed…”<br>
    <small>(Ezekiel 10:18)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>Even in the days of My Son,<br>
  He stood before the temple<br>
  and said with fire in His voice:</p>

  <blockquote>
    “You’ve made it a den of thieves.”<br>
    <small>(Matthew 21:13)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He wept over the city<br>
  that killed prophets<br>
  and beautified tombs<br>
  but missed the living Word among them.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>And now?<br>
  You’ve built new temples.<br>
  Temples of fame,<br>
  screens glowing brighter than stars.<br>
  Pulpits of popularity.<br>
  Churches where the sermon is safe<br>
  and the cross is cute.</p>

  <p>You built temples with Wi-Fi<br>
  but forgot the fire.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>You made apps with devotionals,<br>
  but your hearts stayed disconnected.<br>
  You sang about Me on Sundays,<br>
  but denied Me in your algorithms.<br>
  You opened conferences with worship,<br>
  but closed your eyes to the homeless man outside.<br>
  You offered Me a portion,<br>
  but kept your whole heart for yourself.</p>

    “You have a reputation of being alive,<br>
    but you are dead.”<br>
    <small>(Revelation 3:1)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You forgot that I am the temple.<br>
  That no building, no brand, no pastor<br>
  can replace the thunder of My Spirit.</p>

  <p>I never asked for marble.<br>
  I asked for mercy.<br>
  I never desired programs.<br>
  I desired people.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Do you not know that you are My temple?”<br>
    <small>(1 Corinthians 3:16)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But your temples are full…<br>
  and your hearts are empty.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Still… I knock.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Behold, I stand at the door and knock…”<br>
    <small>(Revelation 3:20)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Not at the door of a building,<br>
  but the soul.<br>
  The quiet place behind the noise.</p>

  <p>Let Me in —<br>
  not to your platform,<br>
  but to your prayer.<br>
  Not to your event,<br>
  but to your everyday breath.<br>
  Let Me be home again.</p>

  <h2>🔥 Chapter 9: Temples Without Me</h2>
  <p><em>(With Sabbath truth, prophecy, and divine sorrow)</em></p>
  <hr />

  <p>I watched them build.<br>
  They carved stone.<br>
  They raised walls.<br>
  They said, “This is for You.”<br>
  But I was not there.<br>
  Not in the smoke machines.<br>
  Not in the polished sermons.<br>
  Not in the choirs that sang to be seen,<br>
  nor in the doctrines that changed My Word<br>
  to suit man’s convenience.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>They changed My day.<br>
  The seventh day I blessed,<br>
  the Sabbath of rest —<br>
  the day I made holy<br>
  before there was a nation,<br>
  before there was Israel,<br>
  before there was sin.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “And on the seventh day God ended His work…<br>
    then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it…”<br>
    <small>(Genesis 2:2–3)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But they shifted it.<br>
  Not by My command.<br>
  Not by My voice.<br>
  But by the hand of empires and councils.<br>
  And they called the first day holy.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Her priests have violated My law…<br>
    they have hidden their eyes from My Sabbaths.”<br>
    <small>(Ezekiel 22:26)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>They held up My Book,<br>
  but closed their eyes to My commandments.<br>
  Ten were given.<br>
  Not nine.<br>
  Not optional.<br>
  Not suggestions.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
    The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God.”<br>
    <small>(Exodus 20:8–10)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Remember.<br>
  But they forgot.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Even My Son, the living Word,<br>
  kept the Sabbath.<br>
  He healed on it,<br>
  taught on it,<br>
  walked among the broken on it.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “As His custom was,<br>
    He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day…”<br>
    <small>(Luke 4:16)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Not once did He change it.<br>
  Not once did He say,<br>
  “Now we gather on the first day.”</p>

  <p>Even His rest in death was on Sabbath —<br>
  His body silent in the tomb<br>
  as the seventh day closed the week of redemption.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>But now…<br>
  You call Sunday the Lord’s Day,<br>
  yet I never claimed it.<br>
  You worship in temples built by men<br>
  and keep traditions shaped by Rome.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “In vain they worship Me,<br>
    teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.”<br>
    <small>(Mark 7:7)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>I was in Eden when Sabbath was born.<br>
  I walked with Adam in the cool of that holy day.<br>
  And I was with Moses on the mountain,<br>
  when fire carved those words in stone.</p>

  <p>The Sabbath is still Mine.<br>
  A sign. A seal. A covenant.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Moreover I also gave them My Sabbaths,<br>
    to be a sign between Me and them…”<br>
    <small>(Ezekiel 20:12)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>You made temples with screens,<br>
  but forgot the Sanctuary of Time.<br>
  You built altars,<br>
  but abandoned the appointed day.<br>
  I never asked for marble.<br>
  I asked for obedience.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Blessed is the man who keeps from defiling the Sabbath…”<br>
    <small>(Isaiah 56:2)</small><br>
    “If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath…<br>
    I will cause you to ride on the high places of the earth.”<br>
    <small>(Isaiah 58:13–14)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>Still… I knock.<br>
  Not to bring you back to a building,<br>
  but to a covenant.<br>
  To a rhythm of rest.<br>
  To a holy space in time that I sanctified for you.</p>

  <p>Return to My day.<br>
  Not to be saved by it —<br>
  but because you love Me.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “If you love Me, keep My commandments.”<br>
    <small>(John 14:15)</small>
  </blockquote>
