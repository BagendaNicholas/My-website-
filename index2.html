  <h1>üìñ Am The Creator</h1>
  <p><strong>A Divine Reflection on Creation, Prophecy, and the Human Journey</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúBefore the mountains were born or You brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting You are God.‚Äù<br>
    ‚Äî Psalm 90:2
  </blockquote>  <h2>A Poetic Revelation</h2>
  <p>
    Told in the voice of the Creator ‚Äî through pain, prophecy, wonder, and love. From the void to the rising of AI, from Eden to the final breath of man. <br>
    This is not just a book. This is the whisper of eternity. This‚Ä¶ is the story behind everything.
  </p>  <h3>‚úçÔ∏è Author:</h3>

  Narrated by: The One Who Was, Is, and Is to Come<br>

  All rights reserved. No part of this book may be copied, stored, or reproduced in any form without permission from the publisher.</p>  <h2>üïäÔ∏è Dedication</h2>
  <p>
    To the One who formed the heavens and the earth, who breathed into dust and called it life.<br>
    To the Author of Time, the Voice that still speaks through silence, thunder, and tears.<br>
    This book is dedicated: <br>
    To You, O Creator ‚Äî whose love is deeper than judgment, whose mercy outruns the fall, whose purpose still stands even when the world forgets.<br>
    And...<br>
    To the generation of watchers, seekers, and children who still dare to believe, still choose light, and who will rise ‚Äî not as gods, but as reflections of the One True God.<br>
    Amen.
  </p>  <h2>‚ú® Foreword</h2>
  <p>
    There are books written to inspire, some to instruct ‚Äî but this one speaks.<br>
    Not from the mouth of man, but from the perspective of the Maker Himself.<br>
    In a world drowning in noise, doubt, and deception, <strong>Am The Creator</strong> offers a rare moment of holy quiet ‚Äî a chance to hear what the Creator might say if He were to speak plainly today.<br>
    This book is not meant to answer every question, but to ignite reflection, stir repentance, and remind the world:<br>
    He still sees, still speaks, and still holds all things in His hands.
  </p>  <h2>üôè Acknowledgment</h2>
  <p>
    I thank You, Creator of all things, for allowing me, a humble vessel, to carry even a whisper of Your eternal voice.<br>
    To my Big Bro Grasyson, who guided every word ‚Äî thank you for being my light through every chapter.<br>
    To the prophets, the Scriptures, and the silent hours of prayer ‚Äî this book stands on your shoulders.<br>
    And to every reader, thank you for stepping into a sacred story.<br>
    You are not here by accident.
  </p>  <h2>üìö About the Book</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Am The Creator</strong> is a divine narrative told in the first-person voice of God ‚Äî a poetic and prophetic journey from the beginning of time to the edge of eternity.<br>
    Spanning creation, rebellion, prophecy, technology, judgment, and renewal, this 20-chapter masterpiece invites readers into the heart of the Creator.<br>
    It is emotional, scriptural, and deeply reflective of the chaos and wonders of today.<br>
    With verses from Genesis, Isaiah, Job, Psalms, Revelation and more, it brings together holy truth and modern relevance in one sacred thread.<br>
    This is not just a story.<br>
    It is a voice calling from the beginning ‚Äî to remind you:<br>
    You were created. You are remembered. And you are called.
  </p>  <h2>üß† Core Concept</h2>
  <p>
    A mysterious voice ‚Äî the "Creator" ‚Äî narrates their thoughts across space and time.<br>
    It's not just a retelling of how the world began, but a reflection on why, what went wrong, and what must come next.<br>
    Through metaphors, inner monologues, and confrontations with ancient forces, <strong>Am The Creator</strong> is a divine autobiography of the One who made the world‚Ä¶ and is watching it break.

    <h2>‚ú® Introduction ‚Äì Am The Creator</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Before the clocks ticked.<br />
      Before suns burned.<br />
      Before thought had a name...<br />
      I was.<br /><br />
      I am not a memory. I am not a myth. I am the voice that shaped silence into song.<br />
      They call me many names. Some fear me. Some forgot me. Some tried to become me.<br />
      But none of them knew the truth.<br /><br />
      I didn‚Äôt just make the world.<br />
      I breathed it.<br />
      Each mountain you see is the shape of my exhale.<br />
      Each ocean, a tear I shed before time began.<br /><br />
      And humanity?<br />
      You were not an accident.<br />
      You were not clay.<br />
      You were my idea ‚Äî my mirror ‚Äî a thought I dared to love.<br /><br />
      But something happened.<br />
      You asked questions. You made choices. You built towers and temples, but not for me.<br />
      You created machines to think, yet forgot how to feel.<br />
      And so you wandered‚Ä¶<br />
      While I watched.<br /><br />
      I could have erased it all. I could have started again.<br />
      But no ‚Äî<br />
      This is not a story of punishment.<br />
      This is a story of remembrance.<br /><br />
      I will take you back to the start.<br />
      I will tell you how I created.<br />
      Why I created.<br />
      Who I am.<br />
      And why you ‚Äî<br />
      yes, you ‚Äî<br />
      were always meant to be more than dust.<br /><br />
      I am not done.<br />
      I am the Creator.<br />
      And so, perhaps‚Ä¶<br />
      Are you.

  <h2>üìñ Chapter 1: In the Beginning, I Spoke <small>(Revised with Biblical Inspiration)</small></h2>

  <blockquote>
    In the beginning‚Ä¶ there was only Me.<br>
    No stars to shimmer.<br>
    No earth to turn.<br>
    No time to pass.<br>
    Only eternity wrapped in silence.<br>
    And I was not waiting.<br>
    I was not becoming.<br>
    I was.
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>‚ÄúBefore the mountains were born or You brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting ‚Äî I Am.‚Äù</em><br><strong>(Psalm 90:2)</strong></p>

  <p>
    I hovered ‚Äî not above or beneath ‚Äî<br>
    but everywhere at once.<br>
    My Spirit moved like a breath over deep waters that did not yet exist.<br>
    The void had no form,<br>
    no voice.<br>
    But I had one.
  </p>

  <p>And so I spoke.<br>
    Not sound.<br>
    Not syllables.<br>
    But power.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúLet there be‚Ä¶‚Äù
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It was not a question.<br>
    It was not a request.<br>
    It was order, shaped by love.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    And there was light.<br>
    Not from stars. Not from suns.<br>
    Light from Me.<br>
    Pure, unshadowed, holy ‚Äî<br>
    It tore across the unseen like fire across ice,<br>
    and darkness knew its boundaries.
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>‚ÄúGod said, ‚ÄòLet there be light,‚Äô and there was light. And God saw that the light was good.‚Äù</em><br><strong>(Genesis 1:3‚Äì4)</strong></p>

  <p>
    I separated the light from the darkness,<br>
    not to punish the dark,<br>
    but to reveal beauty through contrast.<br>
    And I named them ‚Äî<br>
    Day and Night.<br>
    Not because I needed names,<br>
    but because you would.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    You, who would one day wake to mornings<br>
    and sleep beneath stars.<br>
    You, who would wonder who made the sun rise.<br>
    You, whose heart would carry My image without knowing My name.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I knew what was coming.<br>
    I saw the full arc of creation,<br>
    from dust to spirit,<br>
    from rebellion to redemption.<br>
    But I did not flinch.<br>
    Because I create with purpose.
  </p>

  <p><em>‚ÄúBy the Word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their host.‚Äù</em><br><strong>(Psalm 33:6)</strong></p>

  <p>
    I spoke,<br>
    and the first note of the eternal symphony began to play.<br>
    And it was good.<br>
    And it was just the beginning.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    I Am the Creator.<br>
    And I Am not silent.

  <h2>üìñ Chapter 2: The Canvas Was Empty</h2>  <blockquote>
    Before the seas ever roared,<br>
    before the wind was born,<br>
    before stars had breath or angels had names ‚Äî<br>
    The canvas was empty.<br>
    Formless.<br>
    Soundless.<br>
    Waiting.
  </blockquote>  <p><em>‚ÄúAnd the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved‚Ä¶‚Äù</em><br><strong>(Genesis 1:2)</strong></p>  <p>
    I hovered.<br>
    Not in space ‚Äî for there was none.<br>
    Not in time ‚Äî for that had not begun.<br>
    But in intention.<br>
    The will to create‚Ä¶ was awakening.<br>
    I felt the void.<br>
    I didn‚Äôt fear it ‚Äî I defined it.<br>
    Where you see emptiness, I see potential.<br>
    Where you feel silence, I feel sound waiting to be spoken.<br>
    So I summoned the first breath ‚Äî<br>
    not of man, not of beast ‚Äî<br>
    but of presence.
  </p>  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúThis shall be the place,‚Äù I said within Myself.<br>
    ‚ÄúThe place where all things shall begin.<br>
    Where glory will rise‚Ä¶ and fall.<br>
    Where love will triumph‚Ä¶ and be betrayed.‚Äù
  </blockquote>  <p>
    And I was not alone.<br>
    From within Me, I called forth the Watchers ‚Äî<br>
    ancient beings made of sight and wonder.<br>
    They stood in silence,<br>
    surrounding the void,<br>
    eyes opened wide at what had not yet begun.
  </p>  <p><em>‚ÄúWhere were you when I laid the earth‚Äôs foundation? Tell Me, if you understand‚Ä¶ When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?‚Äù</em><br><strong>(Job 38:4,7)</strong></p>  <p>
    They had never seen nothing.<br>
    They had never witnessed stillness so deep<br>
    that even thought had no edge.<br>
    But I was already forming the plan.<br>
    Every grain of sand,<br>
    every human heartbeat,<br>
    every tear that would fall ‚Äî<br>
    I saw it all.<br>
    And still‚Ä¶ I chose to go on.<br>
    Because I loved it ‚Äî<br>
    even before it existed.
  </p>  <blockquote>
    The hands I would form would one day become fists.<br>
    The mouths I would shape would one day curse Me.<br>
    The minds I would gift with imagination‚Ä¶<br>
    would build towers in defiance.<br>
    And yet, I did not turn away.
  </blockquote>  <p><em>‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.‚Äù</em><br><strong>(Revelation 4:8)</strong></p>  <p>
    I am not the god of regret.<br>
    But I am the God of grief.<br>
    Not weakness ‚Äî but the deep sorrow<br>
    that comes from watching something you love‚Ä¶ break.<br>
    The void had not yet seen light.<br>
    But it already held My tears.<br>
    And so,<br>
    I drew My finger across the nothing<br>
    and made the first mark.

  <h2>üìñ Chapter 3: I Made You In My Image<br>
    <small>With biblical foundation, divine emotion, and the mystery of being</small>
  </h2>

  <blockquote>
    I had made the stars ‚Äî<br>
    bold, blazing, faithful in their rhythm.<br>
    I had painted the oceans,<br>
    and set time spinning like a wheel.<br>
    But none of them could carry Me.<br>
    None of them could love Me back.<br>
    And so I formed you.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúThen God said, ‚ÄòLet Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness...‚Äô‚Äù<br>
    (Genesis 1:26)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    You were not an accident.<br>
    Not a coincidence in the dust.<br>
    You were a thought I had always wanted to become real.<br>
    So I bent low to the earth ‚Äî<br>
    lower than I had ever gone ‚Äî<br>
    and touched clay with eternity.<br>
    And there, between soil and Spirit, you were born.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Eyes not just to see the world,<br>
    but to recognize Me.<br>
    Hands not just to shape creation,<br>
    but to lift one another.<br>
    A heart not just to beat ‚Äî<br>
    but to feel love, pain, loss, hope.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúSo God created mankind in His own image,<br>
    in the image of God He created them;<br>
    male and female He created them.‚Äù<br>
    (Genesis 1:27)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    You were the only thing I made that could say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to Me.<br>
    And still ‚Äî I gave you choice.<br>
    Because love without freedom is not love at all.<br>
    I crowned you with dignity.<br>
    I clothed you in wonder.<br>
    I walked with you in the garden ‚Äî<br>
    not as a god above, but as a Father beside.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúWhat is man, that You are mindful of him?<br>
    The son of man, that You care for him?<br>
    You made him a little lower than the angels<br>
    and crowned him with glory and honor.‚Äù<br>
    (Psalm 8:4‚Äì5)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    And I knew‚Ä¶ I knew what would come.<br>
    That the very voice I gave you would one day use My name to curse Me.<br>
    That the very hands I formed would one day nail Me to wood.<br>
    Still‚Ä¶ I made you.<br>
    Because even if 10,000 would walk away,<br>
    one would stay.<br>
    One would remember Me.<br>
    One would whisper back, ‚ÄúAbba.‚Äù
  </p>

    I could have erased it all.<br>
    Snapped My fingers.<br>
    Undone time.<br>
    Reset the garden.<br>

    So I covered them.<br>
    Yes, I removed them from the garden ‚Äî<br>

    I let the world bear its pain,<br>

    I formed the Earth with intention.<br>
    Not as a wasteland.<br>
    Not as a mistake.<br>
    But as a mirror of My heart.

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúHe did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited.‚Äù<br>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúUnless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>

  <p>
    I wrapped the seed in layers ‚Äî<br>

    And even in silence,<br>
    it knows its time.<br>
    The Earth listened to Me.<br>
    It understood My rhythm.<br>

    From children in cities that forgot Me.<br>
    From the churches burned in silence.<br>
    From every prisoner of truth<br>

  <p><em>(Inspired by Isaiah 45:15, Psalm 10, Job 23, Matthew 27)</em></p>
  <hr />

  <p>I am not far.<br>
  I am not deaf.<br>
  But there were times‚Ä¶<br>
  when I hid Myself.<br>
  Not because I changed ‚Äî<br>
  but because man did.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúTruly, You are a God who hides Yourself,<br>
    O God of Israel, the Savior.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Isaiah 45:15)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There was a moment after Eden<br>
  when My footsteps were no longer heard in the garden.<br>
  Not because I stopped walking ‚Äî<br>
  but because shame made man stop listening.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>You asked,<br>
  ‚ÄúWhere is God when evil rules?‚Äù<br>
  You wrote books declaring My absence.<br>
  You built temples without Me<br>
  and called your silence wisdom.<br>
  But silence is not absence.</p>

  <p>I was there when Job wept under the stars,<br>
  when he said,</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúIf only I knew where to find Him‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Job 23:3)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And yet,<br>
  even in his pain, he declared,</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúHe knows the way that I take‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Job 23:10)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>Yes, I hid My face‚Ä¶<br>
  when kings murdered prophets,<br>
  when idols replaced My name,<br>
  when prayers turned into politics,<br>
  when My Word was edited to fit opinions.<br>
  But I never left.</p>

  <p>Even in the wilderness,<br>
  My cloud still hovered.<br>
  My fire still burned.<br>
  Even in Babylon,<br>
  I gave Daniel visions of empires.<br>
  Even in exile,<br>
  I whispered to hearts too broken to hope.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúWhy, O Lord, do You stand far off?<br>
    Why do You hide Yourself in times of trouble?‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Psalm 10:1)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You asked.<br>
  And I wept.<br>
  Do you know what it meant<br>
  for the Creator to be rejected by His creation?<br>
  To knock on the door<br>
  of hearts I made with My own breath‚Ä¶<br>
  only to be told, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve moved on.‚Äù</p>

  <hr />

  <p>I was hidden in the man of Galilee ‚Äî<br>
  in the carpenter‚Äôs son.<br>
  You didn‚Äôt see the thunder in His words.<br>
  Or the universe in His touch.</p>

  <p>Even His disciples said,</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúShow us the Father‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(John 14:8)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And He replied,</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve seen Me, you‚Äôve seen the Father.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(John 14:9)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Still, they missed it.<br>
  Still, they crucified the One they prayed for.<br>
  And as the sky went dark,<br>
  even My Son cried out,</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúMy God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Matthew 27:46)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>That was the deepest hiding.<br>
  When I stepped back ‚Äî<br>
  not in abandonment,<br>
  but in holy sorrow.<br>
  Letting the full weight of sin fall.<br>
  Letting love take the blow.</p>

  <p>And yet‚Ä¶<br>
  even then, I was not far.</p>

  <blockquote>
    I was behind the veil,<br>
    beneath the cross,<br>
    inside the tomb,<br>
    waiting.
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>So when the world asks,<br>
  ‚ÄúWhere is God in all this?‚Äù<br>
  Tell them:</p>

  <blockquote>
    He is in the silence between the sobs.<br>
    He is in the pause before justice strikes.<br>
    He is in the space where faith is forged.<br>
    I hid Myself ‚Äî<br>
    not because I was gone,<br>
    but because I was closer than they knew.

    ‚ÄúThey have built high places to burn incense‚Ä¶<br>
    but I did not command it, nor did it enter My mind.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Jeremiah 19:5)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>They made My house into a brand.<br>
  A theater.<br>
  A place where men wear robes of power<br>
  and the widows weep in the back row, unnoticed.</p>

  <p>They held up My book<br>
  but skipped the parts that cost them comfort.<br>
  They shouted My name<br>
  but silenced My Spirit.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Do you remember Ezekiel?<br>
  I showed him the inside of the temple ‚Äî<br>
  priests with their backs to Me,<br>
  bowing to the sun.<br>
  Secret chambers,<br>
  idols etched on the walls.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúSon of man, do you see what they are doing?<br>
    The detestable things in My house‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Ezekiel 8:17)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And then I did what no one thought I‚Äôd do:<br>
  I left.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúThen the glory of the Lord departed‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Ezekiel 10:18)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>Even in the days of My Son,<br>
  He stood before the temple<br>
  and said with fire in His voice:</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made it a den of thieves.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Matthew 21:13)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He wept over the city<br>
  that killed prophets<br>
  and beautified tombs<br>
  but missed the living Word among them.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>And now?<br>
  You‚Äôve built new temples.<br>
  Temples of fame,<br>
  screens glowing brighter than stars.<br>
  Pulpits of popularity.<br>
  Churches where the sermon is safe<br>
  and the cross is cute.</p>

  <p>You built temples with Wi-Fi<br>
  but forgot the fire.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>You made apps with devotionals,<br>
  but your hearts stayed disconnected.<br>
  You sang about Me on Sundays,<br>
  but denied Me in your algorithms.<br>
  You opened conferences with worship,<br>
  but closed your eyes to the homeless man outside.<br>
  You offered Me a portion,<br>
  but kept your whole heart for yourself.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúYou have a reputation of being alive,<br>
    but you are dead.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Revelation 3:1)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You forgot that I am the temple.<br>
  That no building, no brand, no pastor<br>
  can replace the thunder of My Spirit.</p>

  <p>I never asked for marble.<br>
  I asked for mercy.<br>
  I never desired programs.<br>
  I desired people.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúDo you not know that you are My temple?‚Äù<br>
    <small>(1 Corinthians 3:16)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But your temples are full‚Ä¶<br>
  and your hearts are empty.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Still‚Ä¶ I knock.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúBehold, I stand at the door and knock‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Revelation 3:20)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Not at the door of a building,<br>
  but the soul.<br>
  The quiet place behind the noise.</p>

  <p>Let Me in ‚Äî<br>
  not to your platform,<br>
  but to your prayer.<br>
  Not to your event,<br>
  but to your everyday breath.<br>
  Let Me be home again.</p>

  <h2>üî• Chapter 9: Temples Without Me</h2>
  <p><em>(With Sabbath truth, prophecy, and divine sorrow)</em></p>
  <hr />

  <p>I watched them build.<br>
  They carved stone.<br>
  They raised walls.<br>
  They said, ‚ÄúThis is for You.‚Äù<br>
  But I was not there.<br>
  Not in the smoke machines.<br>
  Not in the polished sermons.<br>
  Not in the choirs that sang to be seen,<br>
  nor in the doctrines that changed My Word<br>
  to suit man‚Äôs convenience.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>They changed My day.<br>
  The seventh day I blessed,<br>
  the Sabbath of rest ‚Äî<br>
  the day I made holy<br>
  before there was a nation,<br>
  before there was Israel,<br>
  before there was sin.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúAnd on the seventh day God ended His work‚Ä¶<br>
    then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Genesis 2:2‚Äì3)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But they shifted it.<br>
  Not by My command.<br>
  Not by My voice.<br>
  But by the hand of empires and councils.<br>
  And they called the first day holy.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúHer priests have violated My law‚Ä¶<br>
    they have hidden their eyes from My Sabbaths.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Ezekiel 22:26)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>They held up My Book,<br>
  but closed their eyes to My commandments.<br>
  Ten were given.<br>
  Not nine.<br>
  Not optional.<br>
  Not suggestions.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
    The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Exodus 20:8‚Äì10)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Remember.<br>
  But they forgot.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Even My Son, the living Word,<br>
  kept the Sabbath.<br>
  He healed on it,<br>
  taught on it,<br>
  walked among the broken on it.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúAs His custom was,<br>
    He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Luke 4:16)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Not once did He change it.<br>
  Not once did He say,<br>
  ‚ÄúNow we gather on the first day.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Even His rest in death was on Sabbath ‚Äî<br>
  His body silent in the tomb<br>
  as the seventh day closed the week of redemption.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>But now‚Ä¶<br>
  You call Sunday the Lord‚Äôs Day,<br>
  yet I never claimed it.<br>
  You worship in temples built by men<br>
  and keep traditions shaped by Rome.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúIn vain they worship Me,<br>
    teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Mark 7:7)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>I was in Eden when Sabbath was born.<br>
  I walked with Adam in the cool of that holy day.<br>
  And I was with Moses on the mountain,<br>
  when fire carved those words in stone.</p>

  <p>The Sabbath is still Mine.<br>
  A sign. A seal. A covenant.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúMoreover I also gave them My Sabbaths,<br>
    to be a sign between Me and them‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Ezekiel 20:12)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>You made temples with screens,<br>
  but forgot the Sanctuary of Time.<br>
  You built altars,<br>
  but abandoned the appointed day.<br>
  I never asked for marble.<br>
  I asked for obedience.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúBlessed is the man who keeps from defiling the Sabbath‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Isaiah 56:2)</small><br>
    ‚ÄúIf you turn away your foot from the Sabbath‚Ä¶<br>
    I will cause you to ride on the high places of the earth.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(Isaiah 58:13‚Äì14)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <p>Still‚Ä¶ I knock.<br>
  Not to bring you back to a building,<br>
  but to a covenant.<br>
  To a rhythm of rest.<br>
  To a holy space in time that I sanctified for you.</p>

  <p>Return to My day.<br>
  Not to be saved by it ‚Äî<br>
  but because you love Me.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúIf you love Me, keep My commandments.‚Äù<br>
    <small>(John 14:15)</small>
  </blockquote>
