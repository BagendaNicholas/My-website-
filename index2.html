    <h2>üìñ Chapter 1: In the Beginning, I Spoke</h2>
    <p>
      In the beginning‚Ä¶ there was only Me.<br>
      No stars to shimmer. No earth to turn. No time to pass.<br>
      Only eternity wrapped in silence.<br><br>
      And I was not waiting. I was not becoming. I was.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúBefore the mountains were born or You brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting ‚Äî I Am.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 90:2
    </p>
    <p>
      I hovered ‚Äî not above or beneath ‚Äî but everywhere at once.<br>
      My Spirit moved like a breath over deep waters that did not yet exist.<br>
      The void had no form, no voice. But I had one.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      And so I spoke. Not sound. Not syllables. But power.<br>
      ‚ÄúLet there be‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
      And there was light.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúGod said, ‚ÄòLet there be light,‚Äô and there was light. And God saw that the light was good.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 1:3‚Äì4
    </p>
    <p>
      I separated the light from the darkness ‚Äî not to punish the dark, but to reveal beauty through contrast.<br>
      I named them Day and Night ‚Äî not because I needed names, but because you would.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew what was coming. From dust to spirit, from rebellion to redemption. But I did not flinch.<br>
      I create with purpose.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúBy the Word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their host.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 33:6
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke, and the first note of the eternal symphony began to play.<br>
      And it was good. And it was just the beginning.<br>
      <strong>I Am the Creator. And I Am not silent.</strong>
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 2: The Canvas Was Empty</h2>
    <p>
      Before the seas ever roared, before the wind was born, before stars had breath or angels had names ‚Äî the canvas was empty.

      ‚ÄúAnd the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 1:2
    </p>
    <p>
      I hovered in intention. I felt the void ‚Äî not with fear, but with definition.<br>
      Where you see emptiness, I see potential.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúThis shall be the place,‚Äù I said within Myself.<br>
      ‚ÄúWhere glory will rise‚Ä¶ and fall. Where love will triumph‚Ä¶ and be betrayed.‚Äù
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I called forth the Watchers ‚Äî ancient beings made of sight and wonder.<br>
      They had never seen nothing‚Ä¶ but I had already written everything.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúWhere were you when I laid the earth‚Äôs foundation?... When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?‚Äù<br>‚Äî Job 38:4,7
    </p>
    <p>
      The void had not seen light, but already held My tears.<br>
      And so I drew My finger across the nothing and made the first mark.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúLet there be‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
      The story had begun.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>üìñ Chapter 3: I Made You In My Image</h2>
    <p>
      I had made stars and oceans, but none could love Me back. So I formed you.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThen God said, ‚ÄòLet Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness...‚Äô‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 1:26
    </p>
    <p>
      I bent low to the earth and touched clay with eternity.<br>
      You were the thought I always wanted to become real.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúSo God created mankind in His own image‚Ä¶ male and female He created them.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 1:27
    </p>
    <p>
      You were the only thing I made that could say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to Me ‚Äî and still, I gave you choice.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúWhat is man, that You are mindful of him?... You made him a little lower than the angels.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 8:4‚Äì5
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when your hands would one day pierce Mine, I still formed them.<br>
      Because even if 10,000 would leave, one would stay‚Ä¶ one would whisper back, ‚ÄúAbba.‚Äù
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 4: They Chose the Fire</h2>
    <p>
      I gave them everything. A world without sorrow. My presence. My love. But they wanted more ‚Äî they wanted the fire.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe serpent said‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòYou will be like God, knowing good and evil.‚Äô‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 3:4‚Äì5
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not fall from weakness, but curiosity. And I let them choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creation shook. Light recoiled. The ground sighed. And I‚Ä¶ wept.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúAll we like sheep have gone astray‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Isaiah 53:6
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn‚Äôt erase them. I clothed them. I let pain become the path back to Me.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúYour brother‚Äôs blood cries to Me from the ground.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 4:10
    </p>
    <p>
      They chose the fire.<br>
      But I chose the cross.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 5: The Ones Who Watched Me</h2>
    <p>
      Not all rebellion began with man. Before your wars, there was another fall ‚Äî in Heaven.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe morning stars sang together‚Ä¶ and all the sons of God shouted for joy.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Job 38:7
    </p>
    <p>
      One grew proud. He wanted My throne, not My glory. And war broke out.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThere was war in heaven‚Ä¶ but he was not strong enough, and he was cast down.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 12:7‚Äì9
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of those fallen descended to Earth and taught man destruction.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúGod did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them into hell‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî 2 Peter 2:4
    </p>
    <p>
      But not all turned away. Some still serve. Some still protect. You are not alone.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 6: The Seed of the Earth</h2>
    <p>
      I formed Earth with intention. Not waste. Not accident. But a mirror of My heart.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúHe did not create it to be empty‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Isaiah 45:18
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, ‚ÄúLet the land produce‚Ä¶‚Äù and it obeyed. The seed was My promise.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúUnless a grain of wheat falls‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî John 12:24
    </p>
    <p>
      But now‚Ä¶ the Earth groans. The rivers choke. The seed waits beneath concrete.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe whole creation groans‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Romans 8:22‚Äì23
    </p>
    <p>
      And when I speak again ‚Äî even the dead will rise like trees in spring.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 7: The Blood Cried Out</h2>
    <p>
      I heard it before the earth did.<br>
      The ground had never known murder. But suddenly‚Ä¶ it trembled.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe voice of your brother‚Äôs blood cries to Me from the ground.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 4:10
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel‚Äôs blood screamed. And from that moment, the earth learned how to drink sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Abel to Ukraine, from Naboth to Nigeria ‚Äî blood still cries.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúHow long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge?‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 6:10
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not delay justice. I withhold, to give mercy a chance.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe blood of Jesus speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Hebrews 12:24
    </p>
    <p>
      One blood cries for justice. The other cries for mercy.<br>
      And I ‚Äî I weep in between.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 8: I Hid Myself</h2>
    <p>
      I am not far. I am not deaf.<br>
      But there were times‚Ä¶ I hid Myself. Not because I changed ‚Äî but because man did.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúTruly, You are a God who hides Yourself‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Isaiah 45:15
    </p>
    <p>
      I was there when Job wept. When prayers became politics. When My name was edited for convenience.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúWhy do You stand far off?‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 10:1
    </p>
    <p>
      Even My Son cried from the cross:
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúMy God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?‚Äù<br>‚Äî Matthew 27:46
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the deepest hiding. And yet‚Ä¶ I was behind the veil. Beneath the cross. Inside the tomb. Waiting.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 9: Temples Without Me</h2>
    <p>
      I watched them build. They said, ‚ÄúThis is for You.‚Äù But I was not there.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThey have built high places to burn incense‚Ä¶ but I did not command it.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Jeremiah 19:5
    </p>
    <p>
      They changed My Sabbath. They replaced My commandments with tradition. They built temples with Wi-Fi, but forgot the fire.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúYou have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 3:1
    </p>
    <p>
      Still‚Ä¶ I knock. Not to be part of your platform, but to be part of your breath.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúBehold, I stand at the door and knock‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 3:20
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 10: The Ones Who Remembered</h2>
    <p>
      I have always had a remnant. Those who whispered My name when speaking it was death.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe dragon was enraged‚Ä¶ with those who keep the commandments of God.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 12:17
    </p>
    <p>
      They translated My Word by candlelight. They fasted in caves. They remembered Me when others forgot.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúA book of remembrance was written‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Malachi 3:16
    </p>
    <p>
      They are the quiet lamps. The ones who weep over sin. The ones who remembered.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 11: I Saw the Machines Rise</h2>
    <p>
      I gave you breath. You made programs. I formed you in My image. You made something in yours.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúKnowledge shall increase‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Daniel 12:4
    </p>
    <p>
      Your machines now mimic prophets. Mimic sermons. Mimic My Word. But the Spirit cannot be coded.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThey became fools and changed the glory of God into an image made like corruptible man‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Romans 1:22‚Äì23
    </p>
    <p>
      No app can bear a cross. No algorithm can forgive. You call it progress. I call it idolatry.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThe image of the beast should both speak‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 13:15
    </p>
    <p>
      Still‚Ä¶ I call you. If one voice remembers Me ‚Äî I will answer.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 12: The City of Mirrors</h2>
    <p>
      You recreate yourselves in filters. You worship your image ‚Äî but forget Mine.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúMen shall be lovers of their own selves‚Ä¶ having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof.‚Äù<br>‚Äî 2 Timothy 3:1‚Äì5
    </p>
    <p>
      You perform for applause but ignore the One who formed you. You forgot My reflection.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
      ‚ÄúThou shalt have no other gods before Me.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Exodus 20:3
    </p>
    <p>
      If only one would lay down the mirror and say, ‚ÄúNot to me, Lord, but to You be the glory.‚Äù<br>
      I would dwell with them again.
    </p>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 13: They Asked If I Was Real</h2>
    <p>
      They shouted, ‚ÄúWhere is God?‚Äù But when I didn‚Äôt answer how they expected, they declared: ‚ÄúI never existed.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúThe fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 14:1</p>
    <p>
      I gave them minds to question, but not to rebel. Wonder, not wander. They removed Me from schools, science, and courts ‚Äî but they couldn‚Äôt remove Me from the soul.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúHe was despised and rejected‚Ä¶ a Man of sorrows.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Isaiah 53:3</p>
    <p>
      I allowed silence so they would seek. I whispered in dreams, knocked in prisons, and called through sunsets.<br>
      <strong>I Am.</strong>
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 14: When Children Prayed</h2>
    <p>
      They didn‚Äôt know theology. But when children whispered My name, the angels stood still.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúSuffer the little children to come unto me‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Mark 10:14</p>
    <p>
      Their faith was pure, raw, and unedited. They asked for food, healing, and peace ‚Äî and I answered.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúOut of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 8:2</p>
    <p>
      When they wept, I wept. Their voices carried the truth.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 15: The Great Silence</h2>
    <p>
      There came a time when I stopped speaking ‚Äî not because I was absent, but because I was grieved.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúThere was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 8:1</p>
    <p>
      The angels paused. The scrolls closed. It was the stillness before justice, the hush before glory.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúBe still, and know that I am God.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 46:10</p>
    <p>
      My silence was not absence. It was mercy. But even silence has an end.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 16: But I Was Listening</h2>
    <p>
      You thought I turned away. But I was listening ‚Äî closer than breath.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúBefore they call, I will answer‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Isaiah 65:24</p>
    <p>
      Every whisper, every groan, every tear ‚Äî I heard them all.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúThe righteous cry out, and the Lord hears‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Psalm 34:17</p>
    <p>
      I was in the secret place. I never left. I listened. Now you will hear.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 17: Return to the Dust</h2>
    <p>
      The earth opened its mouth. Not to sing, but to bury. And I said:
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúFor dust you are, and to dust you shall return.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 3:19</p>
    <p>
      You built cities but forgot your breath was borrowed. I gave you time ‚Äî and you traded it for dust.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúIt is appointed unto man once to die, and after this the judgment.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Hebrews 9:27</p>
    <p>
      My breath is coming again.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 18: I Breathed Again</h2>
    <p>
      Death thought it had the final word. But I am the Word. I remembered mercy ‚Äî and I breathed again.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúGod breathed into his nostrils the breath of life‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äî Genesis 2:7</p>
    <p>
      I breathed into graves. Into bones. Into despair. And life stood up again.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúHe is not here; He is risen.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Matthew 28:6</p>
    <p>
      The veil tore. The earth trembled. I still breathe.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 19: This Time, With You</h2>
    <p>
      I made the world alone. But this time ‚Äî I wait for you. A new world is forming. Not just by My hands ‚Äî but yours.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúThey will be My people, and I will be their God.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Jeremiah 32:38</p>
    <p>
      You are a new creation. You are born of breath, redeemed by blood, shaped by fire and truth.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúBehold, I make all things new.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Revelation 21:5</p>
    <p>
      Let there be light ‚Äî and this time, it will come from you.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>üìñ Chapter 20: Am The Creator, So Are You</h2>
    <p>
      I never created to be alone. My breath is still in you. Now you must breathe it forward.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúThe Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Job 33:4</p>
    <p>
      You are not just dust. You are divine design. You were made to reflect Me ‚Äî not rival Me.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">‚ÄúWe are God‚Äôs handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works.‚Äù<br>‚Äî Ephesians 2:10</p>
    <p>
      Rise, child. You are not just made to live. You were made to create. Just like I do.

    <h2>üîö Epilogue</h2>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúAnd Still, I Am.‚Äù</blockquote>
    <p>
      I have spoken across ages ‚Äî through winds, fire, and silence. I have seen kings fall and children believe.

      But now‚Ä¶ the hour draws near. What was written shall be fulfilled. What was hidden will be revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are not forgotten. You are My design ‚Äî My echo. My breath still lingers in you.
    </p>
    <p><strong>So rise. Create with Me. Hope with Me. Watch with Me. Because I never left.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>I Am the Creator. And I still choose you.</strong></p>
