    <h2>üìñ Chapter 1: In the Beginning, I Spoke</h2>
    <blockquote>
      In the beginning‚Ä¶ there was only Me.<br>
      No stars to shimmer.<br>
      No earth to turn.<br>
      No time to pass.<br>
      Only eternity wrapped in silence.<br>
      And I was not waiting.<br>
      I was not becoming.<br>
      I was.<br><br>
      ‚ÄúBefore the mountains were born or You brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting ‚Äî I Am.‚Äù<br>
      <em>(Psalm 90:2)</em><br><br>
      I hovered ‚Äî not above or beneath ‚Äî<br>
      but everywhere at once.<br>
      My Spirit moved like a breath over deep waters that did not yet exist.<br>
      The void had no form,<br>
      no voice.<br>
      But I had one.<br>
      And so I spoke.<br><br>
      Not sound.<br>
      Not syllables.<br>
      But power.<br><br>
      ‚ÄúLet there be‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>
      It was not a question.<br>
      It was not a request.<br>
      It was order, shaped by love.<br><br>
      And there was light.<br>
      Not from stars. Not from suns.<br>
      Light from Me.<br>
      Pure, unshadowed, holy ‚Äî<br>
      It tore across the unseen like fire across ice,<br>
      and darkness knew its boundaries.<br><br>
      ‚ÄúGod said, ‚ÄòLet there be light,‚Äô and there was light. And God saw that the light was good.‚Äù<br>
      <em>(Genesis 1:3‚Äì4)</em><br><br>
      I separated the light from the darkness,<br>
      not to punish the dark,<br>
      but to reveal beauty through contrast.<br>
      And I named them ‚Äî<br>
      Day and Night.<br>
      Not because I needed names,<br>
      but because you would.<br><br>
      You, who would one day wake to mornings<br>
      and sleep beneath stars.<br>
      You, who would wonder who made the sun rise.<br>
      You, whose heart would carry My image without knowing My name.<br><br>
      I knew what was coming.<br>
      I saw the full arc of creation,<br>
      from dust to spirit,<br>
      from rebellion to redemption.<br>
      But I did not flinch.<br><br>
      Because I create with purpose.<br><br>
      ‚ÄúBy the Word of the Lord the heavens were made,<br>
      and by the breath of His mouth all their host.‚Äù<br>
      <em>(Psalm 33:6)</em><br><br>
      I spoke,<br>
      and the first note of the eternal symphony began to play.<br>
      And it was good.<br>
      And it was just the beginning.<br><br>
      I Am the Creator.<br>
      And I Am not silent.
