 <section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>We live in a world full of distractions, confusion, and pain. The temptation to stay connected to the world’s systems—often symbolized as "Babylon"—pulls us away from the true peace God offers. But getting out of Babylon means more than just leaving a physical place; it involves breaking free from the world's destructive influences, lies, and suffering.</p>
  <p>Let’s look at why we suffer, where suffering comes from, and who is in charge of all suffering, to help us understand our journey out of Babylon and how to find true healing and peace in Christ.</p>
 </section>
  
 <section id="why">
  <h2>1. Why Do We Suffer?</h2>

  <h3>Human Condition and Free Will:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The root of suffering comes from humanity’s fall in the Garden of Eden. When Adam and Eve disobeyed God, sin entered the world, and along with it, suffering, pain, and death.</li>
    <li>Romans 5:12 – “Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Galatians 6:7 reminds us that the choices we make have consequences: “Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.” Sometimes, we suffer because of poor choices, either our own or others’ actions.</p>

  <h3>Suffering as a Result of Babylon's Influence:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Babylon symbolizes the world’s temptations, pride, and distractions. The world calls us to chase after wealth, fame, and selfish desires, which often lead to pain and emptiness.</li>
    <li>1 John 2:16 – “For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Spiritual Growth Through Suffering:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>God uses suffering to refine us and strengthen our character. It’s a part of the process of growing in faith and trust in Him.</li>
    <li>Romans 5:3-4 – “Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.”</li>
    <li>James 1:2-4 encourages us to find joy in suffering: “Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking.”</li>
  </ul>
 </section>
 <section id="where">
  <h2>2. Where Does Suffering Come From?</h2>

  <h3>The Fall of Man:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The origin of suffering goes back to the fall of humanity. When Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, sin entered the world and brought suffering with it.</li>
    <li>Genesis 3:16-19 – “To the woman he said, ‘I will make your pains in childbearing very severe... To Adam he said, ‘Because you listened to your wife and ate the fruit... cursed is the ground because of you...”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Satan’s Influence:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Satan plays a key role in causing suffering. He tempts us, deceives us, and leads us away from God’s plan for our lives. His goal is to steal, kill, and destroy.</li>
    <li>1 Peter 5:8 – “Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Our Own Choices:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sometimes, suffering is the result of our own sinful actions. When we choose things contrary to God's will, we invite pain into our lives. But God is merciful and always ready to forgive and guide us back.</li>
    <li>Hosea 8:7 – “They sow the wind and reap the whirlwind.”</li>
  </ul>
 </section>
 <section id="who">
  <h2>3. Who is in Charge of All Suffering?</h2>

  <h3>God is Sovereign:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Though suffering exists, we must remember that God is sovereign over everything. Nothing happens without His permission, and He can use suffering to teach us, refine us, and bring us closer to Him.</li>
    <li>Romans 8:28 – “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.”</li>
    <li>Isaiah 55:8-9 – “For my thoughts are not your thoughts... so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Jesus Understands Our Suffering:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Jesus, who lived among us, experienced suffering firsthand. He is not distant but knows our pain and struggles intimately.</li>
    <li>Hebrews 4:15 – “For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses...”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Promise of Comfort and Victory:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Though we suffer now, God promises comfort and ultimate victory over pain. He will wipe away every tear and restore what has been lost.</li>
    <li>2 Corinthians 1:3-4 – “Praise be to the God... who comforts us in all our troubles...”</li>
    <li>Revelation 21:4 – “He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain...”</li>
  </ul>
 </section>
 <section id="conclusion">
  <h2>4. Conclusion: Breaking Free from Babylon’s Suffering</h2>

  <h3>Escaping Babylon's Grip:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We must turn away from the world's temptations and systems of suffering (Babylon). God calls us to a higher life—one that leads to peace, joy, and eternal hope.</li>
    <li>John 16:33 – “I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace... But take heart! I have overcome the world.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Choosing Faith Over Fear:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No matter the suffering we face, God is in control. Our suffering is not the end; it's a temporary part of our journey.</li>
    <li>Romans 8:18 – “I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The verse that says <em>“Come out of Babylon”</em> is:</p>

  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #00ffcc; padding-left: 1rem; color: #00ffcc;">
    <p><em>Revelation 18:4 (KJV):</em></p>
    <p>"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This verse is a call for God’s people to separate from the corrupt systems and practices symbolized by “Babylon.”</p>
